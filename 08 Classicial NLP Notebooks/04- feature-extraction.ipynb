       " 'Conviction of Sin\\n\\n\\t\\tA meta-exegetical or methodological essay\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nI look forward to reading it.  When I got to the library last week, it\\nwas with the object in view to look at some articles that have appeared\\nover the last few years, since my previous look at the literature.  Un-\\nfortunately, they had moved the journal back-issues, so I didn\\'t get a\\nlook at the articles I was hoping to find.  I will continue to reserve\\nmy own judgment on _arsenokoitai_ until I have seen the latest scholarly\\nwork, and I can hope that REXLEX\\'s posting may give some meat to chew on.\\n\\nHowever, what I *can* do now, is to point out the methodological issues\\n-- what needs to be shown for anything to be concluded in this matter.\\nIf the article REXLEX posts addresses these issues, so much the better;\\nif not, you will perhaps understand why the problem is hard.\\n\\n\\nwrites, _in abstractu_:\\n\\n\\n\\t[it is only a minor point, but let me make it anyway; De Young has\\n\\talready contradicted his own prior assertion in this abstract that\\n\\tthe ancient analysis of these issues was concerned with actions and\\n\\tNOT with orientation.  I doubt this will have much bearing on the\\n\\tarticle as such, but thought I should point it out from the start.]\\n\\nThe hypothesis De Young is advancing is that Paul a) coined the word and\\nb) his intended meaning for it was in reference to the Levitical law.  The\\nquestions I wish to raise are\\n\\n\\t1.)  how would one go about confirming the truth of this hypothesis?\\nand\\t2.)  what follows if one accepts (or stipulates, for the sake of the\\n\\t     discussion) that it is correct?\\n\\nNote that b) is independent of a); I consider b) far more plausible than a),\\nwhich seems merely to be a counsel of despair over finding nothing in the\\nliterature contemporary with Paul to clarify this word.  So far as I know,\\nPaul does NOT in general invent words anywhere else in his letters.  Unless\\nyou have an otherwise-established pattern of coinages, it is *not* sound\\nmethodology to assume it -- particularly if he gives no hint in the immedi-\\nate text to \"fix\" the coinage\\'s meaning for his audience.\\n\\nAs yet, the extract presents no evidence at all.  What do we need to confirm\\nor reject the hypothesis? (which, I should say at the outset, I find somewhat\\nplausible; I certainly know of nothing which makes it an *impossible* way\\nof construing this problem passage.)  I\\'m going to set aside for the moment\\nthe question of whether Paul might have coined this usage, to look at the\\nmore tractable question of what it means.  For this there are, in principle,\\ntwo kinds of evidence that can be adduced, internal and external.  That is,\\nwe can look at the text of Paul\\'s letter for clarification or look outside\\nthat to prior or contemporary writings that Paul might have relied on, or to\\nderivative writings that have some claim of access to Paul\\'s meaning.\\n\\nThe single WORST problem with this word in Corinthians is that there IS no\\ninternal evidence for Paul\\'s meaning.  He uses the word totally without an\\nexplanation or hint as to his meaning, save that its inclusion in a list of\\nnegatives implies that it has for him SOME negative meaning.\\n\\nWe are left, as the only \"internal\" clue, with the etymology or formation\\nof the word -- which is indeed the reason that De Young (and others before\\nhim) have associated it with the Leviticus prohibition of men VERBing with\\nother men, where VERB is some standard euphemism for having sex (\"lie\" in\\nLeviticus, \"bed\" in Greek).  One problem is that \"bedders\" (_-koitai_) is\\nnot, as far as I know, USED that way in Greek.  THEREFORE, I offer one\\nserious test which de Young\\'s hypothesis *must* pass or be rejected:\\n\\n\\to  find a body of Greek texts contemporary with Paul (or not much\\n\\t   prior to his day) such that the _X-koitai_ formation implies\\n\\t   \"men who have sex with X\"  [obviously, the \"best case\" is to\\n\\t   find such usages of _arsenokoitai_ itself.]\\n\\nsuch texts would be confirmation that the word *can* be read that way.\\nIt is worth emphasizing that compound words are NOT in general under-\\nstandable by projecting what the READER may imagine by the juxtaposition\\nof the roots.  Existence of such parallels doesn\\'t *prove* the hypothesis\\ncorrect -- but it goes a long way towards making such a usage (whether or\\nnot original with Paul in the specific case of X == _arse:n_) possible\\nof comprehension by his readers.\\n\\nMy \"test\" moves in the direction of external evidence.  If Paul does NOT\\nin his text explain his word (and he does not), then he has to expect his\\nreaders to already know the word (which stands against its being a coinage)\\nor to expect that it mimics word formations that they *do* know, such that\\nthey can guess his meaning without too much floundering.\\n\\nExternal evidence, that is, texts other than Paul\\'s own and lexicographic\\nor social/historical considerations that might be adduced, then come into\\nthe picture.  *If* there are other uses of the word, not dependent on Paul,\\nwhich *have* sufficient internal (contextual) evidence -- or some gloss by\\na contemporary scribe -- to show a derogatory reference to male homosexu-\\nality, or similar _-koitai_ formations used in similar ways, *then* one\\nhas grounds for\\n\\n\\to  denying that Paul coined the word\\nand\\to  assuming that his readers might understand his meaning\\n\\nDo you see the problem?  If Paul coined the word, then he REQUIRES his\\nreaders to share enough context with him to COMPREHEND his coinage and\\nits intent -- in this case that they would (stipulating De Young\\'s guess)\\nunderstand him to be referring to the Levitical \"universal\" prohibition\\nof male-male sex (this, mind you, in a context where Paul has emphasized\\nat least to OTHER congregations (and so one assumes to the Corinthians --\\nhow else to explain 1 Cor. 6:12, and the Corinthians having to be pulled\\nback from overinterpreting their freedom?) the NON applicability of Torah\\nlaw to his gentile converts!)\\n\\nAmong the considerations that make it implausible for Paul to have coined\\nthe word, its first element is archaic -- _arse:n_ is an old Attic or\\nIonic form of what in even classical (let alone koine) times would be\\nassimilated as _arre:n_.  To me, this implies that we are even more than\\nusually needful of external evidence to pin down meaning and usage.  What\\nis Paul doing inventing a word in obsolete Attic formation?\\n\\nAnd if he *didn\\'t* coin the word, but picked it up like the others in\\nhis list as common terms of derogation, then his meaning will be -- for\\nhis readers -- constrained by that common meaning (since he gives no\\nother.)\\n\\nI cannot emphasize enough that Paul DOES NOT TELL US what he means by\\nthis word.  We (and his original readers) are guessing.  They, at least,\\nhad a contemporary context -- and maybe Paul had used this very word and\\nexplained it in great detail to them in person.  But we have no trace of\\nevidence of that, and to *suppose* it is mere fantasy.\\n\\nSo -- we are *desperately* in need of external evidence about this word.\\nAnd it seems to be exceptionally meagre.  That is precisely the problem.\\nI can think of several more or less equally plausible hypotheses about\\nthe word:\\n\\n\\ta)  it was a standard gutter term of abuse for (some or all, maybe\\n\\t    very specific, maybe very general) homosexual male activities\\n\\n\\tb)  it was a term of abuse used by Jews about the awful homosexual\\n\\t    Greeks (which may or may not be consciously associated on their\\n\\t    part with the Leviticus passage)\\n\\n\\tc)  Paul invented the term -- and again there may or may not be an\\n\\t    association with Leviticus in his doing so.  He may or may not\\n\\t    intend the word to have an explicit and universal application\\n\\t    with absolute and clear boundaries.  [Since none of his OTHER\\n\\t    words in that list have such character, this last seems to me\\n\\t    about the *least* plausible of the hypotheses I\\'m advancing.]\\n\\nOf these, I\\'d say off the top of my head that a) is most plausible -- but\\nI still have reservations about that, too.\\n\\nIf the word NEVER appears before Paul, and in later uses has some evidence\\nof depending on Paul, then one can opt for Paul\\'s coining it.  If it does\\nappear before him, he might *still* have coined it being unaware of prior\\nuse (in which case, his coinage is inherently confusing!) but one should\\nnormally demote c) on the basis of any earlier uses (especially if they\\ncan be shown to have been at all common in the places Paul traveled.)  In\\neither of the a) or b) cases, one has to take into account Paul\\'s relation\\nto the community of usage he picked the word up from -- and whether it be\\nfrom the Greek or Jewish communities, Paul\\'s relations are hardly straight-\\nforward!\\n\\nThere is, so far as I have yet seen, little or no external evidence to aid\\nus in selecting one of these (or some other) hypothesis.  Your guess is as\\ngood as mine (or maybe worse or maybe better, depending on a lot of things).\\nBut it remains -- so far -- guesswork.  And I don\\'t know about you, but I\\nfor one WILL NOT equate human guesswork with the will of God.  By all means\\nbe convinced in your own conscience about what Paul is getting at -- as he\\nsays elsewhere on what was in HIS day a major controversy of somewhat this\\nsame character (Romans 14:22-23)\\n\\n\\t\"Hold on to your own belief, as between yourself and God -- and\\n\\tconsider the man fortunate who can make his decision without going\\n\\tagainst his conscience.  But anybody who eats in a state of doubt\\n\\tis condemned, because he is not in good faith, and every act done\\n\\tin bad faith is a sin.\"\\n\\nFor my part, I cannot see any way to resolve Paul\\'s meaning in the use of\\n_arsenokoitai_ without directly applicable external evidence -- and by\\nthe nature of such external evidence, it will never reach to certainty\\nof constraining Paul\\'s own intent.  Paul, like Humpty Dumpty (and me, and\\nall the rest of us) *will* use words in ways that are personal choices --\\nand sometimes leave his readers puzzled.  If that puzzlement leads you\\nto God, it may be blessed -- if it should lead away (as some of Paul\\'s\\nwords HAVE led some people), then Paul\\'s intense communicative effort to\\ncontrive his meaning in our souls may have some regretable consequences.\\nI have always found Paul to be a fantastically reliable guide -- if I\\nread him \"in the large\", if I can see him lay out his position in detail\\nand hammer it home time and time again.  I am much less certain about his\\nmeaning in his many brief and cryptic passages (such as this one.)\\n\\nIn my usual discursive way, I have gone on at great length about the first\\nof my intended meta-exegetical points -- what would be needed to confirm\\nthat Paul a) coined or b) in any case meant the word to mean the same as\\nthe Leviticus prohibition.  My second point is to *stipulate* this hypo-\\nthesis, and follow up what it implies for both his initial readers and\\nfor later Christians.  Given my verbosity, this will be tomorrow night\\'s\\nmeditation :-)',\n",

This dates right back to\\nthe Constitutions of 1738, which cite Adam as the first Mason. I\\'ve\\nseen other claims which place Masonry among the Romans, Greeks, and\\nEgyptians, and Atlanteans.

If I fall down in this area\\nI hope you will forgive me.\\n\\nArrogance is not the result of believing one is right or of believing that\\none\\'s God is greater than the god\\'s of others or of believing that one\\'s\\nreligion is better than other religions.

Therefore, I must always consider my beliefs\\ncorrect.  That\\'s not arrogance.  That\\'s unavoidable behavior.\\n\\nIt is nonsense to say that I believe another person\\'s god to be greater than\\nmy God.  Were his or her god greater, wouldn\\'t I be obligated to change so\\nthat their god would become my God?  We are naturally obligated to worship\\nthat God which we deem to be the greatest.  Why should we feel obligated to\\nworship a second best god for the sake of feeling humble?\\n\\nArrogance is not necessarily thinking onesself to be better looking or more\\nintelligent or stronger or having more resources than another person.  No\\ndoubt many will have to chew on this one awhile.  Were passive observation\\nof one\\'s superior points arrogance, then God would be most arrogant of all.\\n\\nHumility does not rest in slandering or belittling God\\'s work of creation in\\nour lives.  People often go around trying to be humble saying to one another,\\n\"I\\'m not very smart.  I\\'m poor.  I\\'m not good looking.  I\\'m just a worm in\\nthe ground.  I\\'m such a weak person and although I don\\'t want to sin, I\\nreally cannot help it.\"  Were this person truely humble, he would take a\\ndifferent approach.  \"God, thank you for making me the way you did.

Please\\nhelp me to change.\"\\n\\n: \\n: I think people take exceptional offense to religious arrogance because\\n: they don\\'t want to be wrong.  If I find someone arrogant, I typically\\n: don\\'t have anything to do with them.\\n\\nFor me, I\\'ve often found it hard to tell the difference.  Often times, the\\nmost humble christian has come across to me as arrogant while the most\\nproud \"worm in the ground\" false humility type person has been found to be\\nmost comfortable company.\\n\\nWhen I\\'m wrong and arrogant about my wrongness, I certainly don\\'t feel like\\nbeing confronted by my wrongness.  Were someone to confront me verbally with\\nmy wrongness, I\\'d be likely to snap at them and examine them head to toe for\\nall their faults and charge them with hypocricy for what they said to me.\\nAt the root, my desire would be to make them shut up so that I can go about\\nliving my life arrogantly as I wish.  However, were someone to confront me\\nsilently by their example, earn my respect, and perhaps mention it to me in\\nhumility in private, I\\'d feel broken down and challenged to seek God for help\\nin changing from the error of my ways.\\n\\nThe hard part is getting to the point to where I can be humble before anyone\\nregardless of their humility or pride--regardless of their hypocricy or\\nsincerity--regardless of whether onlookers will frown down upon me or not.\\nIt isn\\'t easy to take this pain in love with thankfulness for the opportunity\\nto improve in one\\'s ability to serve God.  It\\'s easier to cast aside any hope\\nof reaching true humility and merely hide behind slandering God\\'s creation\\nin our lives instead.\\n\\n: But we should examine ourselves [I hope I typed this back in right]\\n: and why we react to certain situations with such emotions.  For instance,\\n: many of us feel \"justified\" to be insulted by an arrogant person.  As if\\n: we needed a reason to feel insulted.  But after being insulted over and\\n: over again by the words of others, you\\'d think we\\'d either toughen up\\n: or decide not to be insulted, or ignore the insult.  Just because you\\n: can justify feelings of anger or insult or outrage, that doesn\\'t make that\\n: reaction the appropriate one.  It is in this light of self-examination\\n: that we can change our emotional reactions.\\n: \\n\\nSometimes it helps when we can understand and feel the difference between\\nwhat is a true statement of our character and what is a false and slanderous\\nstatement of our character.  The devil is the accuser of the bretheren.  He\\nwould love us to feel hopelessly guilty where we are innocent and feel arrogant\\nand self-righteous where we are indeed wrong.  The devil\\'s aim is to get us\\ninto as much misery as he can.  Just think of the devil as a cruel and merci-\\nless criminal who torments a parent by burning his or her children with\\nhot irons.

       " 'It\\'s been a while since I\\'ve reviewed a car but today I paid a visit\\nto an old friend whose love for Audis has been so overwhelming that he\\nmakes a not too sucessful living selling them.\\n\\nWithout further delay, I will get to the 1993 Audi S4:\\n\\n\\n1) Servotronic steering:\\n\\n[For those who are not familiar with what Servotronic is, it is the\\nname for the speed variable power steering manufactured by ZF and\\nused in Audis and BMWs.]\\n\\nI have been outspoken in my damming of Servotronic over the past\\ncouple of months, and this was based on magazine reviews and drives of\\nthe Audi 90 CS quattro and the Audi 100CS fwd.  I am quite happy to\\nreport now that on the S4, the Servotronic is *inoffensive*.  I\\nsuppose that due to the fat gumball tires, the Servotronic has been\\nloaded up more and this, so far has been the best implementation that\\nI have tried.  It is far from perfect, mind you, and I\\'d be much\\nhappier if it was an option that I could refuse, but on the S4, I no\\nlonger consider this to be bad enough where I feel the entire car is\\nruined.\\n\\nThe steering is still a tad too light, but it is accurate and I\\nsuppose the stiffly sprung chassis sends back so much information that\\nsome makes it through to the driver\\'s hands.  So there is feel and\\nthere is accuracy in the S4\\'s steering.  But there is also room for\\nimprovement.  I consider the S4\\'s steering to be better than the\\nJapanese competition, primarily because the Japanese do not believe in\\n\"feel\" and engineer it out completely.\\n\\n\\n2) Engine\\n\\nWheee! What a pressure cooker.  With just 110 miles on the clock I did\\nnot expect the S4 to be producing anywhere close to what it will be\\nputting out 10000 miles later, but still, the car packs a terrific\\npunch.  For a turbocharged machine, it is very unusual in that it\\nencourages lazy driving.  i.e. low revs, high gear.  It is so\\nsupremely flexible that one could hardly believe that there\\'s only 2.2\\nliters of displacement to move this 3700 pound car around in such a\\nfashion.  With maximum torque available at 1950 rpm and a 7200 rpm\\nredline, the car can pretty much be left in third all day.. which\\ntranslates to a speed range of something like 20-100 mph.  A\\nchracteristic that one normally associates with large capacity V8s.\\nThe technical achievement is breadthtaking.\\n\\nThrottle response is right up there with a good atmospheric engine. In\\nfact, it would even put peaky multivalve engines to shame. Downshifts\\nare almost unnecessary.  It is more fun to use the \"overboost\" feature\\nthan to rev the engine.  For those not familiar, the S4 engine features\\nup to 15 seconds of additional turbo boost for passing.  Sort of like\\nlighting up the after burners in a jet fighter, one could, with the\\nright foot only, in third gear, blast the car from 30 to 80 in just a\\nfew moments.. simply by flooring the gas.  As far as the numbers go,\\nmaximum torque available in overboost mode shoots up to about 270 lb\\nft.. incredible for a 2.2 liter.  It takes a few moments for it to\\ndevelop overboost but it is well worth waiting for.  Since this is quite\\na heavy car, one\\'s body parts are not flung around like say, the Corrado\\nVR6.  The acceleration is smooth and strong, somewhat similar to riding\\nin a jetliner as it accelerates down the runway on takeoff.  Also, one\\nis treated to a very distinctive and entertaining whistle from the\\nturbo.. the only entertaining sound to come out of a very\\nrefined but bland sounding 5 banger..\\n\\nYes, Audi has refined the 5 to the point where at 7200 rpm it sounds as\\nserene as it does at 2000.  The smoothness is outstanding, but not quite\\nup to the standards of a very good 6, e.g. a 12 valve BMW.  I\\'d say that\\nin terms of refinement, i.e. willingness to rev, smoothness, lack of\\nharshness under full acceleration it is better than many V6s.  However,\\nlost in the refinement process is the characteristic 5 cylinder bark\\nthat made the older engines so characterful, if not terribly refined.\\nThe 20 valve turbo 5 sounds pretty bland except for the whistle under\\nfull boost.  Subjectively, I\\'d rate the VW VR6 engine as being far more\\nmusical than the turbo 5.. Also, Audi\\'s own V8 is also far more musical,\\nwith a rorty race car growl when pressed,  though none of these can\\nmatch its grunt.\\n\\nThe only hint of the engine\\'s true capacity occurs when one is taking\\noff from rest after the turbo has come to a near stop.  With the extra\\ninertia from the permanently engaged 4wd system, one has to be somewhat\\ndelicate in feeding in the clutch to prevent an embarassing stall. \\nAlternately one could use more revs.. In both cases a very small price\\nto pay for such a fantastic engine.  I think that Audi of America should\\noffer an automatic option for this car, just as they offer (though in\\nextremely small numbers) a 5 speed for the much peakier V8.  The\\ncharacteristics of the engine are perfect for an automatic.  Ironically,\\nin europe a slush is available but none is offered for the land of the\\nslush.  Marketing twits rearing their ugly heads again...\\n\\n\\n3) Chassis\\n\\nI\\'ve noticed that Audis tend to have very wide wheels and relatively\\nmodest tire widths.  The car comes with Firestones of size 225/50 ZR16..\\nwhich is not uncommon at all.  However, the very attractive 5 spoke\\nwheels are no less than 8 inches wide, so there is no sidewall bulge\\nwhatsoever.  Combined with the flared wheel arches, the S4 has a mouth\\nwatering macho, yet subdued look. \\n\\nOn rough concrete, it becomes immediately clear that the new 100 body\\nstyle has made significant advances in structural rigidity as well as\\nroad noise suppression.. I suppose the two are inter-related, but I\\ndigress.  To use a cliche, the S4\\'s body feels like it has been carved\\nout of stone.  Flex is totally undetectable, even when going over rough\\nroads.  With a super rigid body like this stiff springs and stiff dampers\\ndo not cause excessive harshness and while the S4\\'s ride quality will\\nnever worry a Lexus, it will also not draw comparisons to trucks or\\npony cars.\\n\\nThe servotronic steering has already been mentioned.  I consider it to\\nbe inoffensive because it did not inhibit spirited cornering.  I  was\\nable to test the car\\'s cornering powers without too much trepidation. I\\nthink a new concept is at work in this car.  With its fat gumball tires,\\ntalking about understeer or oversteer is practically meaningless.  On a\\nbanked highway on ramp, I went in slow and started applying power as I\\nwent around.  I could feel the g forces build to the point where the\\nskin on my face was being tugged sideways.  Yet the car was totally and\\ncompletely obedient to throttle and steering inputs.. It felt that the\\nlimits were not even close to being approached.  The g forces were\\nthrilling, but the entire affair of going around a curve is strangely\\nuninvolving.  You tell the car what you want and it does it.  End of\\nstory.  I think that I am starting to relate more and more to those\\nreviewers who were highly impressed by the Honda NSX\\'s clinical\\nefficiency but were unable to fall in love with the car.\\n\\nThe brakes have a very good firmness to them and stop the car pretty\\nwell too, though I\\'ve read that they are prone to fade.  I am not too\\nsurprised, since the S4 does not have uprated brakes over the base Audi\\n100 fwd. Harder pads would help, but that in turn would lead to a more\\nwooden response when cold.  I am starting to see a trend among the\\nluxury/sports sedan makers where extra weight is not being offset by\\nadditional braking capacity.  The LS400\\'s fade performance is nothing to\\nbrag about; neither is the Q45\\'s or the Legend\\'s.  Brake fade these days\\nseem to be a forgotten virtue when everybody\\'s attention is focused on\\nanti-lock capability.\\n\\n\\n4) Comfort\\n\\nFor a car with such sporty abilities, its comfort levels are also\\nexcellent.  The cabin is beautifully appointed, with carbon-fiber panel\\ninserts in place of the wood trim of the \\'92 S4.  All the expected\\ngizmos are there.. heated seats, power seats, seat memory, power this\\nand that.  The glaring ommision was the trip computer, which was removed\\nbecause Audi hasn\\'t gotten it to work reliably yet.. That means that the\\ncar has no boost gauge.  A real disappointment taking into account how\\nmuch the turbo dominates its performance.  \\n\\nUnusual for the germans, the S4 comes with a Honda style moonroof, as\\nwell as the very intelligent dial-a-sunroof-position rotary switch.\\n\\nNoise levels, including engine and tire noise is so low that I wouldn\\'t\\nconsider the Lexus\\' advantage in this area to be significant enough\\nto sway a potential buyer.\\n\\n\\n5) Conclusion\\n\\nEven though few will be able to afford an Audi S4 at its sticker price\\nof $48K, the car is a bargain if one takes into account what it has to\\noffer over the competition.  The 20 valve turbo 5 is a real gem, even if\\nit doesn\\'t produce Ferrari sounds.

I think we can all agree (with Paul) that there are SOME kinds of\\nactivity that could be named by \"fornication\" or \"theft\" or \"coveting\" or\\n\"reviling\" or \"drunkenness\" which would well deserve condemnation.  We may\\nor may not agree to the bounds of those categories, however; and the very\\nfact that they are argued over suggests that not only is the matter not at\\nall \"clear\" but that Paul -- an excellent rhetorician -- had no interest\\nin MAKING them clear, leaving matters rather to our Spirit-led decisions,\\nwith all the uncomfortable living-with-other-readings that has dominated\\nChristian discussion of ALL these areas.\\n\\nHomosexual behavior is no different.

A\\ncommandment neither I nor any other gay Christian wishes to break.  Some\\npeople are indeed involved in obsessively driven modes of sexual behavior.\\nIt is just as wrong (though slightly less incendiary, so it\\'s a secondary\\nargument from the \\'phobic contingent) to equate homosexuality with such\\nbehavior as to equate it with the rape of God\\'s messengers.\\n\\nI won\\'t deal with the exegesis of Leviticus, except very tangentially.\\nFundamentally, you are exhibiting the same circularity here as in your\\nassumption that you know what _porneia_ means.  There are plenty of\\nlaws prohibiting sexual behavior to be found in Leviticus, most of\\nwhich Christians ignore completely.  They never even BOTHER to examine\\nthem.

Any anthropology\\ncourse should sensitize you to ritual and clean vs. unlcean as categories\\nin an awful lot of societies (we have them too, but buried pretty deep).\\nAnd I cannot see any ground for distinguishing these bits of Leviticus\\nfrom the \"ritual law\" which NO Christian I know feels applies to us.\\n\\nI\\'m dead serious here.  When people start going on (as they do in this\\nmatter) about how \"repulsive\" and \"unnatural\" our acts are -- and what\\ndo they know about it, huh? -- it is a solid clue to the same sort of\\narbitrary cultural inculcations as the American prejudice against eating\\ninsects.  On what basis, other than assuming your conclusion, can you\\nsay that the law against male-male intercourse in Leviticus is NOT a part\\nof the ritual law?\\n\\nFor those Christians who *do* think that *some* parts of Leviticus can\\nbe \"law\" for Christians (while others are not even to be thought about)\\nit is incumbent on you *in every case, handled on its own merits* to\\ndetermine why you \"pick\" one and ignore another.  I frankly think the\\nwhole effort misguided.  Reread Paul: \"No doubt I am free to do anything.\"\\nBut Christians have a criterion to use for making our judgments on this,\\nthe Great Commandment of love for God and neighbor.  If you cannot go\\nthrough Leviticus and decide each \"command\" there on that basis, then\\nyour own arbitrary selection from it is simply idiosyncracy.  In this\\ncontext, it is remarkably offensive to say:\\n\\n\\nWell, la-ti-da.  So what?  This is almost as slimey an argument as the\\none that homosexuality == rape.  I know of no one who argues seriously\\n(though one can always find jokers) in \"defense\" of bestiality.  It is\\nabsolutely irrelevant and incomparable to the issues gay Christians *do*\\nraise (which concern sexual activity within committed, consensual human\\nadult realtionships), so that your bringing it up is no more relevant\\nthan the laws of kashrut.  If you cannot address the actual issues, you\\nare being bloody dishonest in trailing this red herring in front of the\\nworld.  If *you* want to address bestiality, that is YOUR business, not\\nmine.

Because I have no past experience\\nin a god actually having an effect on my life and because I have never\\nseen evidence for any god beyond what can be explained without the\\nneccessity of a god or which is more convincing than the many fictional\\nworks I have read (And other reasons), I do not believe in any god(s).\\nFrom what I have seen, some people reconcile this lack of evidence by\\nusing faith.\\nIt is faith in that sense (the only way I _currently_ understand the word\\n\"faith\") that I find intellectually dishonest.\\n\\n\\nPascal\\'s wager goes something like this:\\nPremise #1: Either there is or there isn\\'t a God.\\nPremise #2: If God exists, He wants us to believe and will damn us for not\\nbelieving.\\nPremise #3: If God does not exist, then belief in God doesn\\'t matter\\nbecause death is death, anyway.\\nConclusion: Belief in God is superior to non-belief because\\nnon-belief damns us to eternal punishment if we are wrong, while belief in\\nGod only wastes a little time in life if we are wrong.\\n\\nSound pretty straightforward and is logically sound. The problem is,\\nPremise #1 presupposes 1:1 odds between belief and non-belief. This is\\nflat out wrong, because of the sheer number of religions out there and the\\nfact that, for the most part, the religions are mutually exclusive. I have\\nheard theists referred to as \"99% atheists\" because they believe in their\\ngod (or gods) to be the _one_ god (or set of gods). The consequence of\\nthis is \"what if I pick the wrong god?\" Suddenly, the odds don\\'t look so\\ngood because picking the wrong god or wrong doctrines of a god still\\nleaves you with the possibility of being wrong and being damned to another\\ngod\\'s version of hell.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t see how \"disillusionment\" enters into it.

I know this has been dealt with in past Church prnouncements, but there\\nis a philosophical problem here that should examined.\\n\\nT. V.

God the Son has complete access to the human\\n     (  ( Mind\\t)  )\\tmind but the human mind only has access to the mind\\n     (\\t(\\t)  )\\tof God the Son when the Son allows access.  This \\n     (\\t(_______)  )\\texplains why Jesus said even he did not know the \\n     (_____________)\\ttime of the kingdom.\\t\\n\\nThe human will acted in accordance with the divine will according to free\\nhuman decision.  But if the human will would have decided differently than\\nwhat was intended the divine will would have interceded, but this was never\\nthe case.\\n\\nHe employs some very interesting analogies to support the one person/two mind\\ntheory.  The ideas of a completely healthy version of split personality from\\nthe field of psychology, and the intriguing ideas of being in a dream, seeing\\nyourself acting, knowing that is you, but also being omniscient.  \\n\\nThe one hypostasis would be the unity of the two minds.

Almost every car I\\'ve ever owned has been\\na 5-speed.  Because I got a good deal on this car with the 2500 miles, I\\n(knowingly) overlooked the fact that it has an automatic.  But it is a pretty\\nhigh-tech automatic.  It is a fully electronicaly controlled 4-speed with\\ntorque converter lockup.  Even with the automatic, I\\'m getting 35 mpg on the\\nhighway, driving 65-70!.    (but of course driving > 65 is illegal, so I \\nprobably made that sentence up).  :-)     Around town the mileage has been\\naround 25-27, not bad for an automatic.   Of course it doesn\\'t have the\\n\"control\" of a 5-speed, but since I do a lot of city driving, it turns out\\nto be very convenient.

The 195/65(60?)VR14 Firestones on my 93 Probe\\nlook like they\\'re designed for performance (ie rather wide, shallow\\ntread, etc), so they probably won\\'t last as long.  But the car handles\\nvery very very well.  It sticks to the road like glue, even on a rough\\nsurface.\\n\\n\\nDefinitely.  Ford/Mazda did a very very nice job on this one.  The\\ncar has a \"much more expensive than it actually is\" look and feel to it.\\n\\n\\nHaving driven an 89 Probe for 4 years, I find the 93 suspension \"interesting\".\\nThe car actually drives much better than the 89 ... it is a very firm\\nride, and you definitely know about each and every bump in the road.  Yet\\nthe car remains very civilized on even the bumpiest roads.  You Hear and\\nfeel the bumps, yet the car retains its posture very well.\\n\\n\\nWell I wouldn\\'t encourage passenger-carrying in the Probe unless the\\nperson in the front seat likes to sit with his knees to the dash.  As\\nmentioned in the Consumer Reports write-ups, \"consider the back seat\\nas a parcel shelf\".  No biggie to me though (if it had been, I\\'d not\\nhave bought the car!  (but it\\'s definitely not a family car)).\\n\\n\\nA/C is a MUST on any Probe from 89 - 93.  The 93 in particular sends out\\na REAL BLAST of cool air when the AC is on MAX.  That \"lots of glass\" you\\nmentioned is what gives the car the \"very good visibility\" reports you\\nsee in all the write-ups.  Most \"sports/sporty\" cars don\\'t have that\\ngood visibility.\\n\\n\\nThe complaints I\\'ve heard re: exhaust system (on 93\\'s) have been on \\nthe GT.  Of course being a different engine, that is a differeent \\nexhaust system.\\n\\nI was one of those with an 89 who qualified for the free replacement.\\nSince I had already replaced the muffler when I received the notice, \\nI was/am due a refund from Ford.  I applied in February and am Still\\nwaiting.   :-(\\n\\n\\nYes.

If I were Darryl, I\\'d probably answer that\\nquestion, \"The number four spot gets a few more RBI opportunities and I get\\npaid for RBIs.

It would be helpful at salary time--my RBIs were down because I was\\nhitting third--and make him sound like a \"team\" player.

       " 'In the course of discussing the Sabbath with some folks, \\nI came across something that was completely new to me, \\nand I thought I\\'d offer it for comment.\\n\\nTo keep this as brief as possible, let me state my \\nobservation as a declarative statement, and then whoever \\nwants to can comment on it.  Basically, what I think \\nI\\'ve observed is that the phrase \"the Ten Commandments\", \\nas used by Moses, is not a reference to Ex. 20:1-17, but \\nrather a reference to ten distinct discourses from Ex. \\n20:1 through Ex. 31:18.  That is, the phrase \"the Ten \\nCommandments\" should more accurately be translated \"the \\nTen Discourses\", of which the passage we call the \"Ten \\nCommandments\" is really only the first.\\n\\nI\\'m not completely convinced that the above is true, but \\nfor purposes of discussion, let me argue it as though I \\nwas sure.\\n\\nArguments supporting the above idea:\\n\\n1)  There aren\\'t really ten commandments in Ex. 20:1-17.  \\nIn order to get 10 commandments, you have to get two of \\nthem out of verses 3-6, and the verses themselves do not \\nsupport such a division because they are all about not \\nworshipping other gods.  That is, verse 3 commands to \\nhave no other gods, and verse 5 commands to not worship \\nthe idols mentioned in verse 4.  You can\\'t violate \\nverses 5-6 without violating verse 3, indicating that \\nthe whole passage is one command, and leaving us with \\nonly Nine \"Commandments\".  I could go on at length about \\nthis, but for now I\\'ll just stop with this summary.\\n\\n2)  There ARE ten speeches between Ex 20:1 (the beginning\\nof the traditional \"Ten Commandments\") and Ex 31:18 \\n(where God actually gives Moses the two tablets with the \\nTen Commandments/Discourses written on them).  I break \\nthese ten down as follows: 20:1-17; 20:22-26; 21:1-23:33; \\n25:1-30:10; 30:11-16; 30:17-21; 30:22-33; 30:34-38; \\n31:1-11; and 31:12-18.  In most cases, each of these \\npassages begins with some variation of the phrase, \"And \\nthe LORD spoke to Moses, saying...\"  The exception is \\nEx. 21:1, which begins \"Now these are the ordinances \\nwhich you are to set before them...\"\\n\\n3)  The word translated \"commandments\" in the phrase \\n\"the Ten Commandments\" isn\\'t really the word for \\n\"commandment\", its the word for a speech, or an \\nutterance.  It\\'s a word often used for longer discourses \\nrather than individual statements; for instance, when \\ncombined with the word \\'yom\\' (day), this word is \\ntranslated \"Chronicles\" in such phrases as \"now the rest \\nof the acts of so-and-so, are they not written in the \\nChronicles of x?...\"  The word for \"commandment\" is \\nfreely used throughout the books of Moses, and perhaps \\nit is significant that when Moses spoke of the Ten X\\'s, \\nhe appears to have avoided the word for commandment and \\nchosen instead a word associated with discourses longer \\nthan just a single command.\\n\\n4)  God tells Moses that He is going to give him the \\nstone tablets \"with the law and the commandments\" (Ex \\n24:12), yet He does not give Moses the tablets until He \\nhas finished all ten discourses on Mount Sinai.  If the \\nTen Commandments were only Ex. 20:1-17, it is not \\nimmediately clear why God would wait several days and \\nnine more discourses before giving these tablets to \\nMoses.  On the other hand, if we have the Ten Discourses \\nwritten on the tablets, then it makes perfect sense that \\nGod would not give Moses the tablets until He had \\nfinished delivering all Ten Discourses.\\n\\n5)  When Moses did get the tablets, he found that both \\ntablets were written on both sides (Ex. 32:15).  If \\nthese Ten \"Commandments\" were only the first 17 verses \\nof Ex. 20, God would have had to have written in LARGE \\nletters!  Not that He couldn\\'t have, of course, but it \\ndoes seem more likely to me that this is a reference to \\ntwo tablets containing ten discourses written in normal-\\nsized letters.\\n\\n6)  In II Cor. 3, Paul seems to specifically single out \\nthe \"commandments written on stone\" as being the \\n\"ministry of death\", \"that which is fading away,\" and \\n\"the ministry of condemnation.\"  With the possible \\nexception of the commandment about the Sabbath, it is \\ndifficult to see why Paul would refer to the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17 as being temporary, \"fading away\"-type \\ncommandments.  This is less of a problem if the stone \\ntablets should happen to have included all of the \\ncommandments from Ex 20 through Ex 31.\\n\\nArguments against this idea:\\n\\nThe main argument against this idea, aside from the fact \\nthat it contradicts a long-standing tradition, is that \\nin Dt 5:22, Moses says, after quoting the commands in \\nEx. 20:1-17, \"These words the LORD spoke...and He added \\nno more.  And He wrote them on two tablets of stone and \\ngave them to me.\"  This appears to identify the words \\njust quoted as being the only contents of the two stone \\ntablets.\\n\\nThat was my first impression, anyway.  However, after \\nsome thought, I noted that a great deal hinges on how \\nyou understand the phrase \"These words.\"  If Moses meant \\n\"These words *which I have just related to you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc., then that would mean that only the \\ntraditional \"Ten Commandments\" were on the stone \\ntablets.  If, however, Moses was making a parenthetical \\ncomment--\"These words *which I AM NOW telling you* were \\nspoken by God\" etc.--then that\\'s quite different.\\n\\nI did note that in the Dt 5 account, Moses tells of \\nbeing given the stone tablets BEFORE telling of the \\npeople asking Moses to represent them before God, \\nwhereas in the Exodus account, the people asked this of \\nMoses between the first and second discourses, several \\ndays BEFORE God gave Moses the stone tablets.  This \\nreinforces the idea that Moses\\' remarks in Dt 5:22ff \\nwere intended as a parenthetical remark, rather than a \\nstrictly chronological account of when God wrote what, \\nand at what point He stopped adding to what was on the \\ntablets.\\n\\nSummary:  all things considered, I find it somewhat more \\nlikely that the nine commands in Ex 20 are really only \\nthe first of what Moses regarded as the Ten Discourses \\nof God.  I don\\'t know if anybody has ever espoused this \\nidea before; it\\'s brand-new to me.  So, while I lean \\ntowards accepting it, I would be very interested in \\nhearing any comments and criticisms anyone may care to \\noffer.',\n",

A \"quick\\nlook\" doesn\\'t do justice to the depth of the book of Jeremiah. Having\\nstudied the Jeremiah/Ezekial period solidly for over a year at one\\nstage of my life, I have to say that there is a great deal of underlying\\ntheological meaning in the judgement prophesies. Let me make one point.\\nThe clash between Jeremiah and the \"false prophets\" was primarily in\\nthe theological realm. The \"false prophets\" understood their relatioship\\nto God to be based on the covenant that the Lord made with David. It is\\npossible to trace within the pages of the Old Testament who this covenant,\\nwhich was initially conditional on the continued obedience of David\\'s\\ndescendants, came to be viewed as an unconditional promise on the part\\nof the Lord to keep a descendant of David\\'s upon the throne and to never\\nallow Jerusalem to subjegated by any foreign power. Jeremiah was not a\\nJudahite prophet. He was from Anathoth, across the border in what had formerly\\nbeen Israelite territory. When he came to prophesy, he came from the\\ntheological background of the covenant the Lord had made with Israel\\nthrough Moses. The northern Kingdom had rejected the Davidic covenant\\nafter the death of Solomon. His theology clashed with the theology of the\\nlocal prophets. It was out of a very deep understanding of the Mosaic\\ncovenant and an actute awareness of international events that Jeremiah\\nspoke his prophesies. The \"judgement prophesies\" were deeply loaded with\\ntheological meaning.\\n\\nIn my opinion, both the Portland earthquake prophesy and the David Wilkerson\\n\"New York will burn\" prophesy are froth and bubble compared to the majestic\\ntheological depths of the Jeremiah prophesies.\\n\\n--\\n                                                                     ___\\nBill Rea                                                            (o o)\\n-------------------------------------------------------------------w--U--w---',\n",

Wilkerson is known as one of\\nthe leading archeologist in the history of Egyptiology and Layard is still\\nbeing refered two after 200 yrs of archeology in the Mesopotamian regions.  He\\nwas recently refered to in a TIME article on Babylonian archeology.  \\n\\nPhony scholarship is when you review their references and find that they have\\nmisquoted or misrepresented the conclusions.  Hislop did not.  His conclusions\\ndo not tickle the ears, that much is self evident.  But to assert that his\\nconclusions are \"spurious\" is without merit.  He gave references to all his\\nconclusions and as I have stated, for the last 25 years I have used his\\nconclusions in debates at RC seminaries and brotherhoods, not to mention the\\nindividual priests and bishops that I have talked to one on one.  No counter to\\nHislops scholarship was made.  The only rebuttals were against his conclusions\\nbecause they do totally undermined the claims of the RCC. He was showing that\\nthe intitution of the RCC was based on the mysteries (which others have shown\\neven to this day in various articles and topics).

If it\\nwas so in Corinth, why could they not have an influence in Rome, the city of\\nseven hills?\\n\\nAlso, you do not have to listen to his conclusions, you can draw your own\\nconclusions by looking at the customs, artifacts, the cerimonial dress, the\\ndocrine of purgatory, etc from the vantage of the mysteries.

Does it have pagan history behind it, and if so,\\nwhy did the RCC chose regardless?\\n\\nAny lay person of middle eastern religion can answer these questions.

I was a Lutheran when I met him and he was a\\nborn and raised Church of Christ member.

I believe that through\\nMary and other women, Chris validated women as worthy disciples - but\\nin the C of C the writings of Paul are taken without exception and I\\nam told that I am not an equal partner in my marriage but the lesser\\nmember, I am to submit to my husband in all things (if I hear that\\nverse one more time....) and I am not to take an active role in\\nanything which might be construed as putting me in authority over men\\n(ie leading prayers, conducting Bible studies etc).

And if I was really angry\\nat the ump, I\\'d rather turn away and catch my breath than\\nturn to him and say something that might get me tossed,\\nespecially at a key moment in the game.\\n\\nWhen Gant turned away, Hirschbeck IMMEDIATELY motioned for Gant\\nto step into the box.  IMO, at this point in time, Hirschbeck\\nwas determined to show Gant exactly WHO was in charge of this game.\\nGant wasn\\'t dawdling; he hadn\\'t had a chance to dawdle.  And Hirschbeck\\nwas simply exercising a power play.  Gant resisted, as many of\\nus might to what we thought was an unreasonable request, and\\nHirschbeck called for the pitch.  At that point, Cox came out on\\nthe field, the pitch was thrown, and many other Braves left the\\ndugout.  Cox was tossed \"protecting his player\".  I was pleasantly\\nsurprised that Gant kept his cool enough to stay in the game.\\n\\nIt\\'s a small sample size, but based on what I saw in that game,\\nMark Hirschbeck has a hair-trigger temper and a need to play\\nGod on the field.  Not good qualities for an umpire.  I will\\nkeep my eyes open for future appearances of Hirschbeck in the \\nfuture, in order to improve my sample size.\\n\\nIMO, any game where you remember the name of the umpire was\\na bad game for the umpire.',\n",

       " '\\nThat would be the Opel GT, sold in this country from \\'69 to \\'73.  It originally\\nhad a 1100 cc engine, which was later replaced by the 1900 cc.  It was based\\non the old Kadett drive train and suspension, with leaf springs in the rear\\nand a single transverse leaf spring in the front.  It looked good, but was\\nlimited as a performer.\\n\\nThere has also been some discussion in this thread about the Manta and other\\nmodels.  In 1971 Opel introduced a new line of models, the 1900 series, that\\nwere also known as model numbers 51, 57, etc.  These cars had the newer\\n1900cc engine and were available as two and four-door coupes, a station wagon,\\nand a \"sport coupe\", known in Europe as the Manta.  At the same time, there\\nwere two 30-series cars, which sold very few numbers, that also had the 1900\\nengine but the Kadett suspension.  The sport coupe, (model 57) was also\\navailable as the Rallye, (57R), with a blacked out hood, tach, and fog lights,\\nbut was mechanically the same except for a numerically higher rear end ratio.\\n\\nIn 1973 the sport coupe was also named the Manta in the US.  1973 was the last\\nyear for the GT in any country, both because of the US bumper height regulations\\nand the fact that FIAT exercised an option on the factory that Opel was leasing\\nto build the GTs.\\n\\nThe 1900 series continued in 1974 with minor body differences.  In 1975, the\\nManta, 1900 sedan (also called the Ascona) and the wagon were available with\\nBosch electronic fuel injection.  These cars also had larger brakes and\\nwider wheels.  These cars were starting to compete with the 1975 Buick Century\\nlow price leader of the time, and were the last Opels imported into the US.\\n\\nFrom 1976 to 1979, cars that sported Buick/Opel badges were still sold by\\nthe Buick dealers, but were rebadged Isuzu I-marks.  The idea was to call them\\nOpels instead of changing the dealers\\' neon signs.\\n\\nVarious models of the 50-series cars dominated the Showroom Stock racing of the\\n70\\'s in their class, and were known as serious 2002-competition.\\n\\nParts are still available from a number of sources.\\n\\n(I still have a \\'73 manta and two \\'75 sedans and all the trick parts I could\\ncollect in 20 years).',\n",

       " '\\nWell, it looks like, just as Doug trumped Tim, beating him to the net\\nwith his defensive analyses, so Tim has gotten in ahead of me.\\n\\nThe way I was doing it was a little different. Being me, of course, I\\nused equivalent averages to work out how many runs a player was worth,\\nand I calculated both rate of performance (fielding equivalent\\naverage) and total performance (fielding equivalent runs). But I\\ncompared, not to the average player, but the replacement player, and\\nhere\\'s why: because the positional adjustment comes built in to the\\nsystem. In the AL of 1992, the average SS is 32.9 runs above\\nreplacement (RAR); cf, 31.6; 2B, 28.8; 3B, 26.3; LF, 26.0; RF, 24.6;\\n1B, 16.9. We may quibble with the exact numbers, but the order looks\\nsubstantially right.\\n\\nIn the equivalent average, I have always set league average to .235. I\\nhad decided in hitting that the replacement level batter has an eqa of\\n.180; the name of that replacement level hitter, often as not, is\\n\"Billy Ripken\". I decided to let the replacement level fielder be the\\nsame distance from .235 as .180, but in the opposite direction as I\\nhave set it up; that makes for an eqa of .280. (Yes, I can add. Runs\\nare proportional to eqa squared; the difference between 180 squared\\nand 235 squared equals the difference to 279 squared, and I rounded\\noff for simplicity). An all-replacement fielding team would have:\\nRandy Milligan at first (.282), Willie Randolph (.269) at second, Leo\\nGomez (.279) at third, Walt Weiss (.269) at short, Kevin Bass (.271)\\nin left, HoJo (.257) in center, and Eric Anthony (.277) in right. Ugh.\\n\\nSo, the total number of RAR for a player is the sum of his batting and\\nfielding RAR. I can rate them by total RAR, or RAR per some number of\\nbatting outs, like 400. An average player has a total RAR of about 55,\\n30 batting, 25 fielding.\\n\\nTotal RAR (bat/field)\\n\\n1. Bonds      152 (124/28)  Ventura    124 (66/58)\\n2.

THis was the way in which Osiris, \\'the\\nson, the husband of his mother,\\' was often exhibited, and what we learn of this\\ngod, equally as in the case of Khonso, shows that in his original he was none\\nother than Nimrod.  It is admitted that the secret system of Free Masonry was\\noriginally founded on the Mysteries of the Egyptian Isis, the goddess-mother,\\nor wife of Osiris.  But what could have led to the union of a Masonic body with\\nthese Mysteries, had they not had particular reference to architecture, and had\\nthe god who was worshipped in them not been celebrated for his success in\\nperfecting the arts of fortification and building?  Now, if such were the case,\\nconsidering the relation in which, as we have already seen, Egypt stood to\\nBabylon, who would naturally be liiked up to there as the great patron of the\\nMasonic art?  The strong presumption is, that Nimrod must have been the man. \\nHe was the first that gained faim in this way.  As the child of the Babylonian\\ngoddess-mother, he was worshipped in the character of Ala mahozim, \\'The God of\\nFortification.\\'  Osiris, the child of the Egyptian Modonna, was equally\\ncelebrated as \\'the strong chief of the buildings.\\'  THis strong chief of the\\nbuildings was origninally worshipped in Egypt with every physicall\\ncharacteristic of Nimrod.  I have already noticed the fact that Nimrod, as the\\nson of Cush, was a negro.  Now, there was a tradition in Egypt, recorded by\\nPlutarch, that \\'Osiris was black\\'.......\"  Hislop\\n\\nIt was like a cold slap to my face, when my wifes uncle brought out his\\ncerimonial dress and it was leopard skin.  I mean real leopard skin.   He told\\nme that only the highest of degrees wore the leopard skin.  (The reason that he\\nstarted telling me all this was that he had just been given a couple of months\\nto live and my wife had led him to a saving faith in Christ and he immediately\\nrepented from \\'mysteries\\' of the lodge!)\\n\\nNimr-rod from Nimr, a \"leopard,\" and rada or rad \"To subdue.\"  It is a\\nuniversal principle in all idolatries, that the high priest wears the insignia\\nof the god he serves.  Any representation of Osiris usually show the wearing of\\nsome leopard.  It is interesting that the Druids of Britian also show, or\\nshould I say hide, this representation.  They, however, worshipped the \"spotted\\ncow\".\\n\\nI\\'ll stand by my statements.  Masonry is of the \"mystery\" religions that all\\nfind their source in Babylon, the great harlot. Sorry Peter,  I do not mean to\\nbe a \"cold slap to the face\" but there is to much evidence to the contrary that\\nMasonry doesn\\'t find its origins in Egypt.  Of the Masons I have personally\\ntalked to, all refered to Egypt as their origin.  Why are you now separating\\nyourself from this which not many years ago, was freely admitted?',\n",

Are you sure you want to say that there are zero verses that clearly \\naddress the issues?\\n\\n\\nThe story in Genesis 19 tells of the citizens of Sodom demanding an opportunity \\nto \"know\" the two men who were Lot\\'s guests; the fact that the Sodomites became \\nangry when Lot offered them his daughters could be seen as indicating that they \\nwere interested only in homosexual intercourse.  Yes, what they wanted was \\nrape, homosexual rape, and everybody agrees that that is wrong.  Some \\nChristians believe that the homosexual aspect of their desire was just as \\nsinful as the rape aspect of their desire.  The passage does not say what it \\nwas that so offended God, whether it was the homosexuality, or the intended \\nrape, or both, but I believe that it is only fair to consider all the possible \\nalternatives in the light of related Scriptures.  I do not believe that those \\nwho believe God was offended by both the homosexuality and the rape are trying \\nto say that homosexuality is itself a form of rape.\\n\\nYou seems to take the view that the *only* sin described in Gen. 19 is in the \\nfact that the Sodomites wanted to commit rape, and that it is unfair to \\n\"stigmatize\" their homosexuality by associating it with the sin of rape.  I can \\nsee how you might reach such a conclusion if you started from the conclusion \\nthat there is nothing wrong with homosexuality, but then again we\\'re not \\nsupposed to start from our conclusions because that\\'s circular reasoning.  If \\nGod is in fact opposed to homosexual intercourse in general, then the more \\nprobably interpretation is that He was at least as offended by the Sodomites\\' \\nblatant homosexuality as He was by their intent to commit rape.  Later on I \\nwill document why I believe the Old Testament portrays God as One who despises \\n*any* homosexual intercourse, even if both partners are consenting adults.\\n\\n\\nThe moderator found my proposal to be circular in that he regarded the church \\nas the proper  authority for determining what *kinds* of marriages would be \\nlegitimate, and thus the church\\'s refusal to recognize \"perverted\" marriages \\nwas circular reasoning.  My questions, however, had nothing to do with the \\nchurch ordaining new kinds of marriages, and so his argument was something of a \\nstraw man.  In terms of my original question, the precise \\ndefinition/translation of \"porneia\" isn\\'t really important, unless you are \\ntrying to argue that the Bible doesn\\'t really condemn extramarital sex.  I\\'m \\nnot sure the moderator was trying to do that.\\n\\nIn any case, I think both you and the moderator have missed the point here.  \\nWhen Jesus was asked about divorce, He replied, \"Have you not read, that He who \\ncreated them from the beginning made them male and female, and said, \\'For this \\ncause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall cleave to his wife; and \\nthe two shall become one flesh\\'?  Consequently they are no longer two, but one \\nflesh.  What therefore God has joined together, let no man separate.\" (Mt. \\n19:4-6).  I read here that the sexual union of a man (male) and his wife \\n(female) is a divinely-ordained union.  In other words, the institution of \\nheterosexual marriage is something ordained and established by God--not by men, \\nand not by the church, but by God.  Men are not supposed to dissolve this \\nunion, in Jesus\\' words, because it is not something created by men.\\n\\nThis is not circular reasoning, this is just reading God\\'s word.  I read in the \\nBible that God ordained the union of male and female.  I do not read of any \\nsimilar divinely-ordained union of two males or two females.  Granted, there \\nhave been uninspired men who have ordained \"alternative\" unions (isn\\'t Caligula \\nreported to have \"married\" his horse?), but the only union that Jesus refers to \\nas \"what God has joined together\" is the heterosexual union of a man and his \\nwife.\\n\\n(Pardon me for mentioning Caligula.  I know that\\'s probably inflammatory, and I \\nshould save it for the discussion on bestiality, in part 2 of this post.  \\nPlease hold off on passing judgement on me until you have read that section of \\nmy reply.)\\n\\nAnyway, my original question was not whether we should translate \"porneia\" in a \\nway that condemns only a select few kinds of extramarital sex, my question was: \\ngiven that heterosexual marriage is the only union described by the Bible as \\ndivinely-ordained, and given a Biblical prohibition against sex outside of \\nmarriage, is homosexual intercourse sinful?  Of course, I see now that first we \\nneed to ask whether the Bible really condemns sex outside of marriage.  You \\nseem to be trying to argue that only certain kinds of extramarital sex (and \\nother sins) are really wrong:\\n\\n\\nAlternatively, it may be that the definition of such terms as \"porneia\" and all \\nthe rest was, in Paul\\'s day, what we would call a FAQ; i.e. the Law, as the \\n\"tutor\" appointed by God to lead us to Christ, had just spent some sixteen \\ncenturies drumming into the heads of God\\'s people the idea that things like \\nhomosexual intercourse were abominations that deserved punishment by death.  \\nPerhaps Paul didn\\'t go into detail on what \"porneia\" &c were because after 1600 \\nyears he considered the question to have been dealt with already.  Perhaps the \\nreason God\\'s apostles and prophets did not devote a great deal of time defining \\na distinct, New Testament sexuality was because He did not intend any \\nsignificant changes in the sexuality He had already established by the Law.  \\nI\\'ll discuss the Law and homosexuality in greater detail below, but I just \\nwanted to point out that the New Testament\\'s failure to develop a detailed new \\nstandard of sexuality is not necessarily evidence that God does not care about \\nsexual conduct--especially after 1600 years of putting people to death for \\npracticing homosexuality!\\n\\n\\nAnd how do you define an \"obsessively driven\" mode of sexual behavior?  How do \\nyou determine the difference between obsessive sexual behavior and normal sex \\ndrives?  Is the desire to have \"sinful\" sex an obsessively driven mode of \\nbehavior?  I think you see that this is circular reasoning:  Why is it defined \\nas sinful?  Because it is obsessive.  What makes it obsessive?  The fact that \\nthe person is driven to seek it even though it\\'s sinful.  Or is it obsessive \\nbecause it is a desire for that which society condemns?  Once again, that\\'s \\ncircular:  Why is it defined as obsessive?  Because the person wants it even \\nthough society condemns it.  Why does society condemn it?  Because it is \\nobsessive.\\n\\nYou seem to be trying to limit the Bible\\'s condemnation of \"porneia\" to only \\n\"perverted\" sex acts, but I don\\'t think you can really define \"perverted\" \\nwithout falling into exactly the same circularity you accuse me of.  What, \\nthen, is Paul condemning when he declares that \"Fornicators...shall not enter \\nthe kindgom of heaven\"?\\n\\n\\nI think you misunderstood me:  I was not trying to make an argument on some \\ntechnical definition of \"porneia\", I was raising the issues of the sinfulness \\nof extramarital sex and the lack of any Scriptural evidence of a homosexual \\ncounterpart to the divinely-ordained union of heterosexual couples.\\n\\n\\nPlease remember what you just said here for when we discuss bestiality, in part \\n2.\\n\\n\\nI am glad you asked.  Would you agree that if God condemns homosexual \\nintercourse even among those who are not under the Law of Moses, then this \\nwould show that God\\'s condemnation of homosexual acts goes beyond the ritual \\nlaw?  If I can show you from Scripture that God punished the homosexual \\nbehavior of people who were *not* under the Law of Moses, would you agree that \\nGod\\'s definition of homosexual intercourse as an abomination is not limited to \\njust the ritual law and those who are under the Law?\\n\\nI\\'ve been having a private Email discussion with a 7th Day Adventist on the \\nsubject of the Sabbath, and my main point against a Christian sabbath-keeping \\nrequirement has been that nowhere in Scripture does God command Gentiles to \\nrest on the sabbath, nor does He ever condemn Gentiles for failing to rest on \\nthe Sabbath.  This illustrates the difference between universal requirements \\nsuch as \"Thou shalt not kill\", and requirements that are merely part of the \\n(temporary, Jews-only) Law of Moses, such as the Sabbath.\\n\\nThe point you are trying to make is that you think the classification of \\nhomosexual intercourse as \"an abomination\" is *just* a part of the temporary, \\nJews-only Law of Moses.  I on the other hand believe that it was labelled by \\nGod as an abomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, and that He punished those \\nguilty of this behavior by death or exile.  Here\\'s why:\\n\\nBack in Genesis 15, God promises to give Abraham all the land that was then in \\nthe possession of \"the Amorite\"--kinda hard on the Amorite, don\\'t you think?  \\nBut in verse 16 we have a clue that this might not be as unjust as it sounds:  \\nit seems God is going to postpone this takeover for quite a while, because \"the \\niniquity of the Amorite is not yet complete\".\\n\\nRemember, this is all long before there was a ritual law.  What then was the \\niniquity the Amorite was committing that, when complete, would justify his \\nbeing cast out of his own land and/or killed?  Go back and look at Lev. 18 \\nagain.  Verses 1-23 list a variety of sins, including child sacrifice, incest, \\nhomosexuality, and bestiality.  Beginning in verse 24, God starts saying, \"Do \\nnot defile yourselves by any of these things; for _by_all_these_ _things_ the \\nnations which I am casting out before you _have_ _become_defiled_.  For the \\nland has become defiled, therefore I have visited its punishment upon it, so \\nthe land has spewed out its inhabitants... For whoever does any of these \\nabominations, those persons who do so shall be cut off from among their \\npeople.\"\\n\\nNotice that God says the Gentile nations (who are *not* under the ritual Law of \\nMoses) are about to be punished because they have \"defiled\" themselves and \\ntheir land by committing \"abominations\" that include incest, bestiality, and \\nhomosexuality.  Flip ahead two chapters to Lev. 20, and you will find these \\nsame \"abominations\" listed, and this time God decrees the death penalty on \\nanyone involved in any of these things, including, specifically, a man \"lying \\nwith another man as one lies with a woman\" (Lv. 20:13).  Their \\n\"bloodguiltiness\" was upon them, meaning that in God\\'s eyes, they deserved to \\ndie for having done such things.  According to Lev. 18:26-29, even \"the alien \\n[non-Jew] who sojourns among you\" was to refrain from these practices, on \\npenalty of being \"cut off [by God?] from among their people.\"\\n\\nUnder the circumstances, I believe it would be very difficult to support the \\nclaim that in the Old Testament God objected only to the intended rape, and not \\nthe homosexuality, in Sodom.  Since God took the trouble to specifically list \\nsex between two consenting men as one of the reasons for wiping out the \\nCanaanite nations, (not homosexual rape, mind you, but plain, voluntary gay \\nsex), I\\'d say God was not neutral on the subject of homosexual behavior, even \\nby those who had nothing to do with the Mosaic Covenant.\\n\\n\\nAccording to II Tim. 3:16, all Scripture is inspired by God and is profitable \\nfor teaching, reproof, correction, and training in righteousness; thus, I \\nbelieve that even though we Gentile Christians are not under the Law, we can \\nlearn from studying it.  If a certain action is defined as a sin because it is \\na violation of the Law, then it is a sin only for those who are under the Law \\n(for example, in the case of Sabbath-keeping).  Where God reveals that certain \\nactions are abominations even for those who are not under the Law, then I \\nconclude that God\\'s objection to the practice is not based on whether or not a \\nperson is under the Law, but on the sinfulness of the act itself.  In the case \\nof homosexuality, homosexual intercourse is defined by God as a defiling \\nabomination for Gentiles as well as Jews, i.e. for those who are not under the \\nLaw as well as for those who are.  Thus, I am not at all trying to say that \\nGentile Christians have any obligation to keep any part of the Law, I am simply \\nsaying that God referred to homosexuality as a sin even for those who are not \\nobligated to keep the Law.  If this is so, then I do not think we can appeal to \\nour exemption from the Law as valid grounds for legitimizing a practice God has \\ndeclared a bloodguilty abomination that defiles both Jew and Gentile.\\n\\n(continued in Part 2)',\n",

Please address the substance of my post rather than rejecting it\\nout of hand. \\nBut, because of the sometimes ambiguous nature of English, I may be\\nmisinterpreting your wording here. Please clarify: did you or did you not\\nmean to call my statements about atheism \"nonsense\"? If so, care to back\\nup that claim?\\n\\n\\nOK, then. Start up the amatuer psycology again. How am I \"broken\"?\\n\\n\\n*YAWN* Excuse me, I don\\'t recall any portion of my post in which I called\\nChristians arrogant quote me, if I did. I do remember calling Christianity\\n\"silly\" and then following that up with information that I was nine years\\nold when I thought that. I also said that I find faith to be intellectually\\ndishonest and I would like to see some sort of proof of your god\\'s\\nexistence. I define \"faith\" as \"belief in the absense of any proof\", BTW.\\n\\nAlso, I subscribe to a.a as I mentioned and we see fundies of all types\\nthere, so in answer to your question: \"no.\"\\n\\nFinally, I\\'d hardly call Christianity \"beseiged\" in this country. I seldom\\nsee Christians ridiculed for merely practising their religion or wearing\\ncrosses or having Christian bumper stickers. I don\\'t know for sure, of\\ncourse, I only say I haven\\'t seen it happening. What I have seen happening\\nis my homosexual and/or friends being beat up, or preached at by people\\nwho claim to be Christ\\'s followers. I know that this sort of thing isn\\'t\\npracticed by the majority of Christians, but it is a very vocal minority\\nwho are doing it and I don\\'t see comperable victimization of Christians. \\n\\n\\nThe implication being that I am not self-respecting, of course. I\\'m not a\\nstudent of psychology, BTW, but I am a student of Creative Writing and\\nLinguistics, so literary analysis _is_ my forte. Also, if the implications\\nI see are improper, please let me know.\\nI\\'m here because I\\'m not sequestered in my own little atheist cubbyhole as\\nyou seem to think atheists should be. Did it occur to you that I _don\\'t_\\nthink I know everything and that maybe someone will say something that\\nwill change my life? Have you read my other posts here or did you see\\n\"atheist\" and decide it was time to poke at someone who doesn\\'t deserve\\nyour respect?\\nAw, geez. I\\'m sorry, I probably am getting my back up a little too high,\\nhere. It\\'s just that the \"nonsense\" thing really annoys me. I figure you\\nshould see my first reactions, though, since they are my true reactions to\\nyour question.\\nNow, the smoothed feather version:\\nI seek all sorts of knowledge. That\\'s why I came to my university. Yes, I\\nam looking at your religion (well, sorta, I have no idea what *kind* of\\nChristian you are) from the outside, and hopefully with an objective view.\\nI\\'ve been trying to ask reasoned questions here, because I genuinely don\\'t\\nknow the answers to them, but when I saw the question directed at atheists\\nI figured I would answer. After all, you can speculate about atheist\\nmotives here all you want (hence the \"amatuer\" psychology crack), but\\nwithout an atheist, you can\\'t be sure of even one atheist\\'s motive.       \\nI\\'m hoping people really\\nwant to know and I was trying to show that I actually checked out several\\nreligions and I actually read all the pamphlets people have to offer and I\\nactually think about these things. Instead, I\\'m still faced with the\\nimplication that atheism is some kind of aberration and that only \"broken\"\\npeople are atheist.\\n\\tTry it from the flip side: I posit that atheism is the natural\\nstate and only broken people are theists. I offer as proof that so many\\npeople witness from horrible lives which picked up as soon as they \\ndiscovered their religion, that religion is regional (if people didn\\'t\\nfollow the religion of their areas, there would be a more homogenous\\nmix), so many terrorists claim theistic motives, and that theists tend\\nto be so pushy and angry when challenged on alt.atheism. Why are religions\\nso successful? Because there is so much suffering in the world, which \\n\"breaks\" people.\\nIt\\'s an uncomfortable situation whichever way you look at it, which is another\\nreason I\\'m here, to try to see the flip side of my thinking (and also as \\na watchdog for logical fallacies :).\\n                                           ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nThe implication here being that atheists can\\'t possibly know anything\\nabout Christianity. Probably jumping at shadows again, but I think my\\nreaction is somewhat justified. After all, the first post suggested that\\natheists are \"broken\", hostile people. This post confirms that someone\\nelse believes it. \\n\\n                                             ^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\nWell, he got me there. I am a strong atheist, because I feel that lack of\\nevidence, especially about something like an omnipotent being, implies\\nlack of existence. However, I haven\\'t met the strong atheist yet who said\\nthat nothing could ever persuade him. Call me a \"seeker\" if you like, I\\ndon\\'t. \\n_Weak_ atheism is being ignore here, though. Some atheists simply say \"I\\ndon\\'t believe in any god\" rather than my position: \"I believe that no\\ngod(s) exist.\" For the weak atheist, the is no atheism to disbelieve,\\nbecause they don\\'t actively believe in atheism. (If you think this is\\nconfusing, try figuring out the difference between Protestants and\\nMethodists from an atheist point of view :).\\nThis is another fallacy many theists seem to have, that everyone believes in\\nsomething (followed up by \"everyone has faith in something\"). Guess what?\\nMy atheism ends the moment I\\'m shown a proof of some god\\'s existence. Is\\nthat really too much to ask?\\n\\n\\n\\nWell, I guess you won\\'t succeed in converting him or me. Why the\\nsupposition that you will fail to convince him? (amatuer psycology on) Is\\nit because you yourself are unconvinced? :) \\n\\nAnd I told you that I find faith to be intellectually dishonest. Note that\\nI can only speak for myself. If you find faith to be honest, show me how.\\nI have been unable to reconcile it so far. Maybe that\\'s how I\\'m \"broken\"?\\nI tell you that I have invisible fairies living in my garden and that\\nyou should just take my word for it. If you accept that, you are of a\\nfundamentally different mind than I and I really would like to know how you\\nthink. All I ask for is proof of the assertion \"God exists\". Logical or\\nphysical proofs only, please. Then we\\'ll discuss the nature of \"God\".\\n\\nPrayer?! Uh, oh, we\\'ll have to revoke his atheist club card and beanie! :)\\n\\n\\nGood luck to you, as well.

       " 'continuing part #4 (I think); used by permission,\\n\\nTHE SOURCE AND NT MEANING\\nOF ARSENOKOITAI, WITH IMPLICATIONS\\nFOR CHRISTIAN ETHICS AND MINISTRY\\n\\n                                      James B. DeYoung\\n\\nW. Petersen\\n\\n     More recently Wright\\'s understanding has itself been questioned from a\\ndifferent direction.  In a brief 1986 study William Petersen found linguistic\\nconfusion in using the English word \"homosexuals\" as the meaning of\\narsenokoitai.[22]   He faulted Wright and English Bible translaions for\\nrendering it by \"homosexuals\" in I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10.\\n\\n     In a sense Petersen has coalesced Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs into a\\nsingle assertion that reiterates, in effect, the position of Bailey.  He finds\\n\"homosexuals\" unacceptable as a translation because it is anachronistic.  \"A\\nmajor disjunction\" exists between contemporary thought and terminology and the\\nthought and terminolgy in Paul\\'s time (187-88).\\n\\n      What is this \"disjunction\"?  He bases it on historical and linguistic\\nfacts.  Accordingly, ancient Greek and Roman society treated male sexuality as\\npolyvalent and characterized a person sexually only by his sexual acts. \\nVirtually all forms of behavior, except transvestism, were acceptable. \\nChristianity simply added the categories of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" in\\ndescribing these actions.  Ancient society know nothing of the categories of\\n\"homosexuals\" and \"heterosexuals,\" and assumed that, in the words of Dover\\nquoted approvingly by Petersen, \"everyone responds at different times to both\\nhomosexual and to heterosexual stimuli. . .\" (188). [23]\\n\\n      In contrast to this, modern usage virtually limits the term \"homosexual\"\\nto desire and propensity.  K.M. Benkert, who in 1869 coined the German term\\nequivalent to \"homosexual,\" used it as referring to orientation, impluse or\\naffectional preference and having \"nothing to do with sexual acts\" (189).\\n\\n     Petersen then proceeds to cite the \"Supplement to the Oxford English\\nDictionary,\"  which defines \"homosexual\" only as a propensity or desire with no\\nmention of acts.  Petersen\\'s point is that by using \"homosexuals\" for\\narsenokoitai, one wrongfully reads a modern concept back into early history\\n\"where no equivalent concept existed\" (189).  Consequently the translation is\\ninaccurate because it \"includes celibate homophiles,. . . . incorrectly exludes\\nheterosexuals who engage in homosexual acts . . . [and]incorrectly includes\\nfemale homosexuals\" (19=89).  Prior to 1869 there was no \"cognitive structure,\\neither inour society or in antiquity, within which the modern bifurcation of\\nhumanity into \\'homosexuals\\' and \\'hetersosexuals\\' made sence\" (189).\\n\\n     The foregoing clarifies why Petersen feels that the translatio\\n\"homosexual\" is mistaken.  Yet is it possible that Petersen is the one\\nmistaken, on both historical and linguistic or philological grounds?  The next\\nphases of this paper will critically examine Petersen\\'s position.\\n\\n                        THE JUSTIFICATION FOR TRANSLATING\\n                          ARSENOKOITAI BY \"HOMOSEXUALS\"\\n\\nHistorical Grounds\\n\\n     A refutation of the foregoing opposition to the traslation of arsenokoitai\\nby \"homosexuals\" begins with the historical and cultural evidence.  Since\\nvirtually everyone acknowledges that the word does not appear before Paul\\'s\\nusage, no historical settings earlier than his are available.  Yet much writing\\nreveals that ancient understanding of homosexuality prior to and contemporary\\nwith Paul.  The goal is to discover wheither the ancient s conceived of\\nhomosexuality, particularly homosexual orientation, in a way similar to\\npresent-day concepts.  \\n\\n     Peterson, Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs claim that the homosexual\\ncondition, desire, propensity, or inversion -whatever it is called- cannot be\\npart of the definition of the term.  They assert this either because the term\\nis limited to acts of particular kind (Boswell, active male prostitutes; \\nScroggs, pederasty) or because the homosexual condition was unknown in ancient\\ntimes (Bailey; Petersen).  The following discussion will show why neither of\\nthese positions is legitimate.  Attention will be devoted to the latter postion\\nfirst with the former one being addressed below under \"Linguistic Grounds.\"\\n\\n     In regard to the latter position, one may rightfully ask, did not the\\nhomosexual condition exist before 1869?  Is it only a modern phenomenon? Yet if\\nit is universal, as alleged today, it must have existed always including\\nancient times, even though there is lack of sophistication in discussing it. \\nIndeed, evidence show that the ancients, pre-Christian and Christian, not only\\nknew about the total spectrum of sexual behavior, including all forms of\\nsame-sex activity (transvestism included), but also knoew about same-sex\\norientation or condition.  Petersen admits (190 n. 10) that Plato in\\n\"Symposium\" (189d-192d) may be a \"sole possible exception\" to ancient\\ningnorance of this condition.  He discounts this, however, believing that even\\nhere \"acts appear to be the deciding factor.\"  However, this is a very\\nsignificant exception, hardly worthy of being called \"an exception,\" because of\\nthe following additional evidence for a homosexual condition.\\n\\n     THe \"Symposium\" of Plato gives some of the strongest evidence for\\nknowledge about the homosexual condition. [24]   Plato posits a third sex\\ncomprised of a maile-female (androgynon (\"man-woman\"). Hence \"original nature\"\\npalai physis, consisted of three kinds of human beings.  Zeus sliced these\\nhuman beings in half, to weaken them so that they would not be a threat to the\\ngods.  Consequently each person seeks his or her other half, either one of the\\nopposite sex or one of the same sex.  Plato then quotes Aristophances:\\n\\n    Each of us, then, is but a tally of a man, since every one shows like\\n    a flatfish the traces of having been sliced in two;  and each is ever\\n    searching for the tally that will fit him.  All the men who are sections\\n    of that composite sex that at first was called man-woman are \\n    woman-courters;  our adulterers are mostly descended from that sex,\\n    whence likewise are derived our mancourting women and adulteresses.\\n    All the women who are sections of the woman have no great fancy for men:\\n    they are incllined rather to women, and of this stock are the she-minions.\\n    Men who are sections of the male pursue the masculine, and so long as \\n    their boyhood lasts they show themselves to be sliced of the male by\\n    making griends with men and delighting to lie with them and to be\\n    clasped in men\\'s embrasces;  these are the finest boys and striplings,\\n    for they have the most manly nature.  Some say they are shameless\\n    creatures, but falsely:  for their behavior is due not to shamelessness\\n    but to daring, manliness, and virility, since they are quick to welcome\\n    their like.  Sure evidence of this is the fact that on reaching maturity\\n    these alone prove in a public career to be men.  So when they come\\n    to man\\'s estate they are boy-lovers, and have no natural interest in\\n    wiving and getting children but only do these things under stress of\\n    custom;  they are quite contented to live together unwedded all their days.\\n    A man of this sort is at any rate born to be a lover of boys or the \\n    willing mate of a man, eagerly greeting his own kind.  Well, when\\n    one of them -whether he be a boy-lover or a lover of any other sort- \\n    happens on his own particular half, the two of them are wondrously \\n    thrilled with affection and intimacy and love, and are hardly to be \\n    induced to leave each other\\'s side for a single moment.  These are\\n    they who continue together throughout life, though they could not\\n    even say what they would have of one another (191d-192c) [25]\\n\\nShould these two persons be offered the opportunity to be fused together for as\\nlong as they live, or even in Hades, Aristophanes says that each \"would\\nunreservedly deem that he had been offered just what he was yearning for all\\nthe time:  (192e).\\n\\n     Several observations about this text are in order.  Lesbianism is\\ncontemplated, as will as male homosexuality (191e).  \"Natural interest\" (ton\\nnoun physei), (192b) refelects modern concepts of propensity or inclination. \\nThe words, \"born to be a lover of boys or the willing mate of a man: \\n(paiderastes te kai philerastes gignetai), (192b) reflect the modern claims \"to\\nbe born this,\" i.e., as homosexual.  The idea of mutuallity (\"the two of them\\nare wondrously thrilled with affection and intimacy and love,\" 192b) is\\npresent.  Aristophanes even speaks of \"mutual love ingrained in mankind\\nreassembling our early estate\" (ho eros emphytos allelon tois anthropois kai\\ntes archaias physeos synagogeus, 191d). The concept of permanency (\"These are\\nthey who continue together throughout life,\" 102c) is also present.  Further\\nmention of and/or allusion to permanecy, mutality, \"gay pride,\" pederasty,\\nhomophobia, motive, desire, passion, and the nature of love and its works is\\nrecognizable.\\n\\n    Clearly the ancients thought of love (homosexual or other) apart from\\nactions.  THe speakers in the Symposium argue that motive in homosexuality is\\ncrucial;  money, office, influence, etc. . . bring reproach (182e-183a, 184b). \\nThey mention the need to love the soul not the body (183e).  There are tow\\nkinds of love in the body (186b) and each has its \"desire\" and \"passion\"\\n(186b-d).  The speakers discuss the principles or \"matters\" of love (187c), the\\ndesires of love (192c) and being \"males by nature\" (193c).  Noteworthy is the\\nspeech of Socrates who devotes much attention to explaining how desire is\\nrelated to love and its objects (200a-201c).  Desire is felt for \"what is not\\nprovided or present; for something they have not or are not or lack.\"  This is\\nthe object of desire and love.  Socrates clearly distinguishes between \"what\\nsort of being is love\" and the \"works\" of love (201e).  This ancient\\nphilosopher could think of both realms -seaual acts as well as disposition of\\nbeing or nature.  His wors have significance for more than pederasty. [26]\\n\\n     In summary, virtually every element in the modern discussion of love and\\nhomosexuality is anticipated in the Symposium of Plato.  Petersen is in error\\nwhen he claims that the ancients could only think of homosexual acts, not\\ninclination or orientation.  Widespread evidence to the contray supports the\\nlatter. [27]\\n\\n     Biblical support for homosexuality inclination in the contexts where\\nhomosexual acts are discribed adds to the case for the ancient distinction.  In\\nRom 1:21-28 such phrases as \"reasoning,\" \"heart,\" \"becoming foolish,\" \"desires\\nof the heart.\" and \"reprobate mind\" prove Paul\\'s concern for disposition and\\ninclination along with the \"doing\" or \"working\" of evil (also see vv. 29-32). \\nEven the catologues of vices are introdiced (I Tim 1:8-10) or concluded (I Cor\\n6:9-11) by words describing what people \"are\" or \"were,\" not what they \"do.\" \\nHabits betray what people are within, as also the Lord Jesus taught (cf. Matt.\\n23:28).  The inner condition is as important as the outer act; one gives rise\\nto the other (cf. Mt 5:27).\\n\\n     Petersen errs regarding other particulars too.  Transvestism apparently\\nwas accepted by the ancients.   It was practiced among Canaaniteds, Syrian,\\npeople of Asia Minor, as well as Greeks, according to S.R. Driver. [28]  Only a\\nfew moralist and Jewish writers are on record as condemning it.  For example,\\nSeneca (Moral Epistles 47.7-8) condemns homosexual exploitation that forces an\\nadult slave to dress, be beardless, and behave as a woman.  Philo also goes to\\nsome length to describe the homosexuals of his day and their dressing as women\\n(The Special Laws III, 37-41;  see also his On the Virtues, 20-21, where he\\njustifies prohibition of cross-dressing).  Even the OT forbade the interchange\\nof clothing between the sexes  (Deut 22:5).\\n\\n     Petersen is also wrong in attributing to Christianity the creating of the\\n\"new labels\" of \"natural\" and \"unnatural\" for sexual behavior.  These did not\\nbegin with Paul (Rom 1:26-27) but go as far back as ancient Greece and even\\nnon-Christian contemporaries used them.  Plato, the TEST.NAPH., Philo, Josephu,\\nPlutarch, and others used these words or related concepts. [29]\\n\\nLinguistic Grounds',\n",

We believe\\nthat energy efficiency, protecting the environment, and a healthy\\neconomy are complimentary goals.\"\\n   O\\'Leary said that plans call for the Department of Energy to\\ncoordinate the agencies\\' five-year purchase plans, help with\\nfunding for extra purchase or conversion costs, and work with GSA\\nto encourage development of the fuel infrastructure needed to make\\nfleet conversions practical.\\n   Under the order, the Department of Energy will also be working\\nwith states, local governments and industry to coordinate vehicle\\npurchases and encourage manufacturers and fuel suppliers to make\\nalternative fuel vehicles and alternative fuels more widely\\navailable.\\n -30-',\n",

       " '\"Hate the sin but love the sinner\"...I\\'ve heard that quite a bit recently, \\noften in the context of discussions about Christianity and homosexuality...\\nbut the context really isn\\'t that important. My question is whether that\\nstatement is consistent with Christianity. I would think not.\\n\\nHate begets more hate, never love. Consider some sin. I\\'ll leave it unnamed\\nsince I don\\'t want this to digress into an argument as to whether or not \\nsomething is a sin. Now lets apply our \"hate the sin...\" philosophy and see\\nwhat happens. If we truly hate the sin, then the more we see it, the \\nstronger our hatred of it will become. Eventually this hate becomes so \\nstrong that we become disgusted with the sinner and eventually come to hate\\nthe sinner. In addition, our hatred of the sin often causes us to say and \\ndo things which are taken personally by the sinner (who often does not even \\nbelieve what they are doing is a sin). After enough of this, the sinner begins\\nto hate us (they certainly don\\'t love us for our constant criticism of their\\nbehavior). Hate builds up and drives people away from God...this certainly\\ncannot be a good way to build love.\\n\\nIn the summary of the law, Christ commands us to love God and to love our \\nneighbors. He doesn\\'t say anything about hate. In fact, if anything, he \\ncommands us to save our criticisms for ourselves. So, how are Christians\\nsupposed to deal with the sin of others? I suppose that there is only one\\nway to deal with sin (either in others or ourselves)...through prayer. We\\nneed to ask God to help us with our own sin, and to help those we love \\nwith theirs. Only love can conquer sin...hatred has no place. The best way to\\nlove someone is to pray for them. \\n\\n- Scott',\n",

There are maybe 6-10 teeth (dogs) on the side of the\\ngears that engage the next gear over as the forks slide the gears back\\nand forth.  To shift:  start to apply pressure at the same time the\\nclutch is pulled (the clutch is a hand lever) and shift quickly.  If \\nyou try a slow lazy shift it will grind, you just have to pop it into\\nthe next gear before it has a chance to grind.  There isn\\'t a neutral\\nbetween gears (obviously there is, but you can\\'t select it with the\\nshifter) so double clutching is not a possibility.  \"speed shifting\"\\n(which is what I have always heard \"clutchless shifting\" called) works\\npretty well for upshifts with some practice, but I usually use the\\nclutch-especially for the lower gears.\\n\\nI think auto (as in automobile) trannys are similar, except that the\\nengagment dogs are very fine, with no slop.  And the addition of\\nsyncho rings.  The gear teeth are always engaged in auto transmissions\\nthat are synchronized, but may not be in non-synchro gears (reverse\\nand sometimes first).  \\n',\n",

The verses in question are Hosea\\n2:5,7 & 10; Jeremiah 4:30, 22:20 & 22; Lamentations 1:19; and Ezekiel\\n16:33, 36 &37 and 23:5, 9 & 22.\\n\\n\\t[ Hosea seems to have originated this usage, which Jeremiah and\\n\\t  Ezekiel picked up;  Lamentations is dependent on, though not\\n\\t  likely written by, Jeremiah. ]\\n\\nThe \"erotic\" meaning (in its allegorical use, not at all literally) is\\nevident.  So too in English, unless you complement it with a phrase like\\n\"of the arts\" the word \"lover\" is going to have an overtone of sexual\\nrelationship.  There is no surprise here, but it is worthwhile to see\\nthat standard Greek usage *does* show up in the translations from the\\nHebrew! :-)\\n\\nMore interestingly, and some confirmation of my guess that later Koine\\nusage avoided the verb _erao:_ because of its homonymy to _ero:_ (say),\\n_eromai_ (ask), there is an error in Codex Vaticanus (normally, a very\\nvaluable witness) where a form of _erao:_ is used in a completely absurd\\ncontext -- 2 Samuel 20:18, where the  meaning *must* be \"say.\"\\n\\nIn addition to the above (and the uses I have already mentioned in Proverbs),\\nEsther 2:17 uses the verb in its most natural application, \\n\\n\\tkai e:rasthe\" ho basileus Esthe:r  --  and the King loved Esther\\n\\nand, rather more interestingly, 1 Samuel 19:2 supplies a modest degree of\\nsupport to the gay appraisal of the relationship of David and Jonathan:\\n\\n\\tkai Io:nathan huios Saoul e:[i]reito ton Dauid sphodra\\n\\t-- and Jonathan, Saul\\'s son, loved David intensely\\n\\n\\t[ I\\'m using the bracketed [i] for io:ta subscript, which I\\n\\t  don\\'t yet have a reasonable ASCII convention for. ]\\n\\n(The relevance of this to the gay issue is not anything implicit about\\nthe \"historical\" facts, but just that a quasi-official translation of\\nthe Hebrew text in the Hellenistic period makes no bones about using the\\n\"erotic\" verb in this context.

It contains far\\nmore detail on the exegetical issues than I give here, though\\nprimarily from a conservative point of view.\\n\\n----------------------------\\n\\nThis posting summarizes several issues involving homosexuality and\\nChristians.  This is a frequently asked question, so I do not post the\\nquestion each time it occurs.  Rather this is an attempt to summarize\\nthe postings we get when we have a discussion.  It summarizes\\narguments for allowing Christian homosexuality, since most people\\nasking the question already know the arguments against it.  The most\\ncommon -- but not the only -- question dealt with herein is \"how can a\\nChristian justify being a homosexual, given what the Bible says about\\nit?\"\\n\\nFirst, on the definition of \\'homosexual\\'.  Many groups believe that\\nthere is a homosexual \"orientation\", i.e. a sexual attraction to\\nmembers of the same sex.  This is distinguished from actual homosexual\\nsexual activity.  Homosexuals who abstain from sex are considered by\\nmost groups to be acceptable.  However in a lot of discussion, the\\nterm \\'homosexual\\' means someone actually engaging in homosexual sex.\\nThis is generally not accepted outside the most \\'liberal\\' groups.  In\\nthis paper I\\'m going to use \\'homosexual\\' as meaning a person engaging\\nin sexual acts with another of the same sex.  I haven\\'t heard of any\\nBiblical argument against a person with homosexual orientation who\\nremains celebate.\\n\\nI think most people now admit that there is a predisposition to be\\nhomosexual.  This is often called a \\'homosexual orientation\\'.  It is\\nnot known whether it is genetic or environmental.  There is evidence\\nsuggesting each.  The best evidence I\\'ve seen is that homosexuality is\\nnot a single phenomenon, but has a number of different causes.  One of\\nthem is probably genetic.  There are several groups that try to help\\npeople move from being homosexual to heterosexual.  The best-known is\\nExodus International\".  The reports I\\'ve seen (and I haven\\'t read the\\ndetailed literature, just the summary in the minority opinion to the\\nPresbyterian Church\\'s infamous report on human sexuality) suggest that\\nthese programs have very low success rates, and that there are\\nquestions about how real even the successes are.  But there certainly\\nare people who say they have converted.  However this issue is not as\\nimportant as it sounds.  Those who believe homosexuality is wrong\\nbelieve it is intrinsically wrong, defined as such by God.  The fact\\nthat it\\'s hard to get out of being a homosexual is no more relevant\\nthan the fact that it\\'s hard to escape from being a drug addict.  If\\nit\\'s wrong, it\\'s wrong.  It may affect how we deal with people though.\\nIf it\\'s very difficult to change, this may tend to make us more\\nwilling to forgive it.\\n\\nOne more general background issue: It\\'s common to quote a figure that\\n10% of the population is homosexual.  I asked one of our experts where\\nthis came from.  Here\\'s his response: Kinsey (see below) is the source\\nof the figure 10 percent.  He defines sexuality by behavior, not by\\norientation, and ranked all persons on a scale from Zero (completely\\nheterosexual) to 6 (completely heterosexual).  According to Kinsey,\\none-third of all male adults have had at least one experience of\\norgasm homosexually post puberty.  Ten percent of all adult males have\\nmost of their experiences of homosexually.  That was in 1948.  The\\npercentages held true in a followup study done by the Kinsey\\nInstitute, based on data in the early seventies but not published\\nuntil the early 80s or so, by Bell and Weinberg, I believe.  I can\\'t\\nput my hand on this latter reference, but here is the online\\ninformation for Kinsey\\'s own study as it appears in IRIS, the catalog\\nat Rutgers:\\n   AUTHOR Kinsey, Alfred Charles, 1894-1956.\\n    TITLE Sexual behavior in the human male [by] Alfred C.

A\\njournalist is running the rounds of talk shows this season promoting\\nher book that allegedly refutes Kinsey\\'s study, but the scholarly\\nworld seems to take her for a kook......\\n\\nI\\'ve seen some objections to the Kinsey\\'s study, but not in enough\\ndetail to include here.  (If someone would like to contribute another\\nview, I\\'d be willing to include it.)\\n\\nMost Christians believe homosexuality (at least genital sex) is wrong.\\nNot all, however.  A few denominations accept it.  The Metropolitan\\nCommunity Churches is the best-known -- it was formed specifically to\\naccept homosexuals.  However the United Church of Christ also allows\\nit, and I think a couple of other groups may as well.  The Episcopal\\nChurch seems to accept it some areas but not others.  In churches that\\nhave congregational government, you\\'ll find a few congregations that\\naccept it (even among Southern Baptists, though the number is probably\\nonly one or two congregations).  But these are unusual -- few churches\\npermit homosexual church leaders.  How carefully they enforce this is\\nanother issue.  I don\\'t have any doubt that there are homosexual\\npastors of just about every denomination, some more open than others.\\n\\nAs to the arguments over the Biblical and other issues, here\\'s an\\nattempt to summarize the issues:\\n\\nThe most commonly cited reference by those favoring acceptance of\\nhomosexuality in previous discussions has been John Boswell:\\n\"Christianity, Social Tolerance, and Homosexuality\", U Chicago Press,\\n1980.\\n\\nThe argument against is pretty clear.  There are several explicit laws\\nin the OT, e.g. Leviticus 20:13, and in Rom 1 Paul seems pretty negative on\\nhomosexuality.  Beyond these references, there are some debates.  Some\\npassages often cited on the subject probably are not relevant.  E.g.\\nthe sin which the inhabitants of Sodom proposed to carry out was\\nhomosexual *rape*, not homosexual activity between consenting adults.\\n(There\\'s even some question whether it was homosexual, since the\\nentities involved were angels.)  It was particularly horrifying\\nbecause it involved guests, and the responsibility towards guests in\\nthat culture was very strong.  (This is probably the reason Lot\\noffered his daughter -- it was better to give up his daughter than to\\nallow his guests to be attacked.)  If you look through a concordance\\nfor references to Sodom elsewhere in the Bible, you\\'ll see that few\\nseem to imply that homosexuality was their sin.  There\\'s a Jewish\\ninterpretive tradition that the major sin was abuse of guests.  At any\\nrate, there\\'s no debate that homosexual *rape* is wrong.\\n\\nI do not discuss Leviticus because the law there is part of a set\\nof laws that most Christians do not consider binding.  So unless NT\\njustification can be found, Lev. alone would not settle the issue.\\n\\nThe NT references are all in Paul\\'s letters.  A number of the\\nreferences from Paul are lists of sins in which the words are fairly\\nvague.  Boswell argues that the words occuring in these lists do not\\nin the lists (i.e. I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10) are /malakos/ and\\n/arsenokoitai/.  Unfortunately it is not entirely clear what the words\\nactually mean.  /malakos/, with a basic meaning of soft, has a variety\\nof metaphorical meanings in ethical writing.  Boswell suggests\\n\"wanton\" as a likely equivalent.  He also reports that the unanimous\\ninterpretation of the Church, including Greek-speaking Christians, was\\nthat in this passage it referred to masturbation, a meaning that has\\nvanished only in the 20th Cent., as that practice has come to be less\\nfrowned-upon.  (He cites references as late as the 1967 edition of the\\nCatholic Encyclopedia that identify it as masturbation.)  He\\ntranslates /arsenokotai/ as male prostitute, giving evidence that none\\nof the church fathers understood the term as referring to\\nhomosexuality in general.  A more technical meaning, suggested by the\\nearly Latin translations, would be \"active mode homosexual male\\nprostitute\", but in his view Paul did not intend it so technically.\\n\\nFor a more conservative view, I consulted Gordon Fee\\'s commentary on I\\nCor.  He cites evidence that /malakos/ often meant effeminate.\\nHowever Boswell warns us that in Greek culture effeminate is not\\nnecessarily synonymous with homosexual, though it may be associated\\nwith some kinds of homosexual behavior.  Given what Boswell and Fee\\nsay taken together, I suspect that the term is simply not very\\ndefinite, and that while it applies to homosexuals in some cases, it\\nisn\\'t a general term for homosexuality.  While Fee argues against\\nBoswell with /arsenokotai/ as well, he ends up suggesting a\\ntranslation that seems essentially the same.  The big problem with it\\nis that the word is almost never used.  Paul\\'s writing is the first\\noccurence.  The fact that the word is clearly composed of \"male\" and\\n\"f**k\" unfortunately doesn\\'t quite tell us the meaning, since it\\ndoesn\\'t tell us whether the male is the subject or object of the\\naction.  Examples of compound words formed either way can be given.\\nIn theory it could refer to rapists, etc.  It\\'s dangerous to base\\nmeaning purely on etymology, or you\\'ll conclude that \"goodbye\" is a\\nreligious expression because it\\'s based on \"God by with ye\".  However\\nsince Boswell, Fee, and NIV seem to agree on \"homosexual male\\nprostitute\", that seems as good a guess as any.  Note that this\\ntranslation misses the strong vulgarity of the term however (something\\nwhich Fee and Boswell agree on, but do not attempt to reproduce in\\ntheir translation).\\n\\nIn my opinion, the strongest NT reference to homosexuality is Romans\\n1.  Boswell points out that Rom 1 speaks of homosexuality as something\\nthat happened to people who were naturally heterosexual, as a result\\nof their corruption due to worshipping false gods.  One could argue\\nthat this is simply an example: that if a homosexual worshipped false\\ngods, he would also fall into degradation and perhaps become\\nheterosexual.  However I find this argument somewhat forced, and in\\nfact our homosexual readers have not seriously proposed that this is\\nwhat Paul meant.\\n\\nHowever I am not convinced that Rom 1 is sufficient to create a law\\nagainst homosexuality for Christians.  What Paul is describing in Rom\\n1 is not homosexuality among Christians -- it\\'s homosexuality that\\nappeared among idolaters as one part of a whole package of wickedness.\\nDespite the impression left by his impassioned rhetoric, I\\'m sure Paul\\ndoes not believe that pagans completely abandoned heterosexual sex.\\nGiven his description of their situation, I rather assume that their\\nheterosexual sex would also be debased and shameless.  So yes, I do\\nbelieve that this passage indicates a negative view of homosexuality.\\nBut in all fairness, the \"shameless\" nature of their acts is a\\nreflection of the general spiritual state of the people, and not a\\nspecific feature of homosexuality.\\n\\nMy overall view of the situation is the following: I think we have\\nenough evidence to be confident that Paul disapproved of\\nhomosexuality.  Rom 1 seems clear.  While I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 are\\nnot unambiguous and general condemnations of homosexuality, they do\\nnot seem like wording that would come from someone who approved of\\nhomosexuality or even considered it acceptable in some cases.  On the\\nother hand, none of these passages contains explicit teachings on the\\nsubject.  Rom 1 is really about idolatry.  It refers to homosexuality\\nin passing.\\n\\nThe result of this situation is that people interpret these passages\\nin light of their general approach to Scripture.  For those who look\\nto Scripture for laws about issues such as this, it not surprising\\nthat they would consider these passages to be NT endorsement of the OT\\nprohibition.  For those whose approach to the Bible is more liberal,\\nit is not surprising that they regard Paul\\'s negative view of\\nhomosexuality as something that he took from his Jewish upbringing\\nwithout any serious reexamination in the light of the Gospel.  As\\nreaders of this group know by now, the assumptions behind these\\napproaches are so radically different that people tend to foam at the\\nmouth when they see the opposing view described.  There\\'s not a lot I\\ncan do as moderator about such a situation.\\n\\nA number of discussions in the past centered around the sort of\\ndetailed exegesis of texts that is described above.  However in fact\\nI\\'m not convinced that defenders of homosexuality actually base their\\nown beliefs on such analyses.  The real issue seems to rest on the\\nquestion of whether Paul\\'s judgement should apply to modern\\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nOne commonly made claim is that Paul had simply never faced the kinds\\nof questions we are trying to deal with.  He encountered homosexuality\\nonly in contexts where most people would probably agree that it was\\nwrong.  He had never faced the experience of Christians who try to act\\n\"straight\" and fail, and he had never faced Christians who are trying\\nto define a Christian homosexuality, which fits with general Christian\\nideals of fidelity and of seeing sexuality as a mirror of the\\nrelationship between God and man.  It is unfair to take Paul\\'s\\njudgement on homosexuality among idolaters and use it to make\\njudgements on these questions.\\n\\nAnother is the following: In Paul\\'s time homosexuality was associated\\nwith a number of things that Christians would not find acceptable.  It\\nwas part of temple prostitution.  Among private citizens, it often\\noccured between adults and children or free people and slaves.  I\\'m\\nnot in a position to say that it always did, but there are some\\nreasons to think so.  The ancients distinguished between the active\\nand passive partner.  It was considered disgraceful for a free adult\\nto act as the passive partner.  (This is the reason that an active\\nmode homosexual prostitute would be considered disgraceful.  His\\ncustomers would all be people who enjoyed the passive role.)  This\\nsupports the idea that it would tend not to be engaged in between two\\nfree adult males, at least not without some degree of scandal.\\nClearly Christian homosexuals would not condone sex with children,\\nslaves, or others who are not in a position to be fully responsible\\npartners.  (However Fee\\'s commentary on I Cor cites some examples from\\nancient literature of homosexual relationships that do seem to involve\\nfree adults in a reasonably symmetrical way.  Thus the considerations\\nin this paragraph shouldn\\'t be pushed too far.  Homosexuality may have\\nbeen discredited for Jews by some of these associations, but there\\nsurely must be been cases that were not prostitutes and did not\\ninvolve slaves or children.)\\n\\nSome people have argued that AIDS is a judgement against\\nhomosexuality.  I\\'d like to point out that AIDS is transmitted by\\npromiscuous sex, both homosexual and heterosexual.  Someone who has a\\nhomosexual relationship that meets Christian criteria for marriage is\\nnot at risk for AIDS.\\n\\nNote that there is good reason from Paul\\'s general approach to doubt\\nthat he would concede homosexuality as a fully equal alternative,\\napart from any specific statements on homosexuality.  I believe his\\nuse of the Genesis story would lead him to regard heterosexual\\nmarriage as what God ordained.\\n\\nHowever the way Paul deals with pastoral questions provides a warning\\nagainst being too quick to deal with this issue legally.\\n\\nI claim that the question of how to counsel homosexual Christians is\\nnot entirely a theological issue, but also a pastoral one.  Paul\\'s\\ntendency, as we can see in issues such as eating meat and celebrating\\nholidays, is to be uncompromising on principle but in pastoral issues\\nto look very carefully at the good of the people involved, and to\\navoid insisting on perfection when it would be personally damaging.\\nFor example, while Paul clearly believed that it was acceptable to eat\\nmeat, he wanted us to avoid pushing people into doing an action about\\nwhich they had personal qualms.  For another example, Paul obviously\\nwould have preferred to see people (at least in some circumstances)\\nremain unmarried.  Yet if they were unable to do so, he certainly\\nwould rather see them married than in a state where they might be\\ntempted to fornication.\\n\\nI believe one could take a view like this even while accepting the\\nviews Paul expressed in Rom 1.  One may believe that homosexuality is\\nnot what God intended, that it occured as a result of sin, but still\\nconclude that at times we have to live with it.  Note that in the\\ncreation story work enters human life as a result of sin.  This\\ndoesn\\'t mean that Christians can stop working when we are saved.  The\\nquestion is whether you believe that homosexuality is in itself sinful\\nor whether you believe that it\\'s a misfortune that is in a broad sense\\ndue to human sinfulness.  If you\\'re willing to consider the latter\\napproach, then it becomes a pastoral judgement whether there is more\\ndamage caused by finding a way to live with it or trying to cure it.\\nThe dangers of trying to cure it are that the attempt most often\\nfails, and when it does, you end up with damage ranging from\\npsychological damage to suicide, as well as broken marriages when\\nattempts at living as a heterosexual fail.\\n\\nThis is going to depend upon one\\'s assessment of the inherent nature\\nof homosexuality.  If you believe it is a very serious wrong, then you\\nmay be willing to run high risks of serious damage to get rid of it.\\nClearly we do not generally suggest that people live with a tendency\\nto steal or with drug addiction, even though attempts to cure these\\nconditions are also very difficult.  However these conditions are\\nintrinsically damaging in a way that is not so obvious for\\nhomosexuality.  (Many problems associated with homosexuality are\\nactually problems of promiscuity, not homosexuality.  This includes\\nAIDS.  I take for granted that the only sort of homosexual\\nrelationships a Christian would consider allowing would be equivalent\\nto Christian heterosexual relationships.)\\n\\nIn the course of discussing this over the last decade or so, we\\'ve\\nheard a lot of personal testimony from fellow Christians who are in\\nthis situation.  I\\'ve also seen summaries of various research and the\\nresults of various efforts for \"conversion\".  (Aside from the\\nPresbyterian report mentioned above, there\\'s an FAQ that summarizes\\nour readers\\' reports on this question.)  The evidence is that\\nlong-term success in changing orientation is rare enough to be on a\\npar with healing miracles.  The danger in advising Christians to\\ndepend upon such a change is clear: When \"conversion\" doesn\\'t happen,\\nwhich is almost always, the people are often left in despair, feeling\\nexcluded from a Church that has nothing more to say but a requirement\\nof life-long celibacy.  Paul recognized (though in a different\\ncontext) that such a demand is not practical for most people, and I\\nthink the history of clerical celibacy has strongly reinforced that\\njudgement.  The practical result is that homosexuals end up in the gay\\nsex clubs and the rest of the sordid side of homosexuality.  Maybe\\nhomosexuality isn\\'t God\\'s original ideal, but I can well imagine Paul\\npreferring to see people in long-term, committed Christian\\nrelationships than promiscuity.  As with work -- which Genesis\\nsuggests wasn\\'t part of God\\'s original ideal either -- I think such\\nrelationships can still be a vehicle for people sharing God\\'s love\\nwith each other.\\n\\nThere\\'s an issue of Biblical interpretation underlying this\\ndiscussion.  The issue is that of \"cultural relativism\".  That is,\\nwhen Paul says that something is wrong, should this be taken as an\\neternal statement, or are things wrong because of specific situations\\nin the culture of the time?  Conservative Christians generally insist\\non taking prohibitions as absolute, since otherwise the Bible becomes\\nsubjective -- what is to stop us from considering everything in it as\\nrelative?\\n\\nWhen looking at this issue, it\\'s worth noting that no one completely\\nrejects the concept of cultural relativism.  There are a number of\\njudgements in the New Testament that even conservative Christians\\nconsider to be relative.  The following judgements are at least as\\nclear in the Bible as anything said on homosexuality:\\n\\n  - prohibition against charging interest (this occurs 18 times in\\n\\tthe OT -- it\\'s not in the NT, but I mention it here because\\n\\tuntil relatively recently the Church did consider it binding\\n\\ton Christians)\\n  - prohibition against swearing oaths\\n  - endorsement of slavery as an institution\\n  - judgement of tax collectors as sinner\\n\\nWe do not regard these items as binding.  In most cases, I believe the\\nargument is essentially one of cultural relativism.  Briefly:\\n\\n  - prohibition of interest is appropriate to a specific\\n\\tagrarian society that the Bible was trying to build,\\n\\tbut not to our market economy.\\n  - few people believe that American judicial oaths have the\\n\\tsame characteristics as the kind of oaths Jesus was\\n\\tconcerned about\\n  - most people believe that Paul was simply telling people\\n\\thow to live within slavery, but not endorsing it as\\n\\tan institution\\n  - for people believe that the IRS is morally equivalent to\\n\\tRoman tax farming\\n\\nThe point I\\'m trying to make is that before applying Biblical\\nprohibitions to the 20th Cent., we need to look at whether the 20th\\nCent. actions are the same.  When Christian homosexuals say that their\\nrelationships are different than the Greek homosexuality that Paul\\nwould have been familiar with, this is exactly the same kind of\\nargument that is being made about judicial oaths and tax collectors.\\nUntil fairly recently Christians prohibited taking of interest, and\\nmany Christians regarded slavery as divinely endorsed.  (Indeed,\\nslavery is one of the more common metaphors for the relationship\\nbetween God and human beings -- Christians are often called servants\\nor slaves of God.)\\n\\nI am not trying to say that everything in the Bible is culturally\\nrelative.  Rather, I\\'m trying to say that *some* things are, and\\ntherefore it is not enough to say that because something appears in\\nthe Bible, that ends the discussion.  We need to look at whether the\\naction we\\'re talking about now has the same moral implications as the\\none that the Bible was talking about.  If Christians want to argue\\nthat there are reasons to think that the prohibitions against\\nhomosexuality are still binding, I\\'m willing to listen.  Those who\\nclaim that the question doesn\\'t need to be looked at are kidding\\nthemselves (unless they are part of the small minority who really obey\\nall the rules listed above).\\n\\nOne thing that worries me is the great emotions that this issue\\ncreates.  When you consider the weakness of the Biblical evidence --\\nsome laws in Leviticus, a passage in Rom whose subject matter is\\nreally idolatry rather than homosexuality, and a couple of lists whose\\nwords are ambiguous -- the amount of concern this is raising among\\nChristians seems rather out of proportion.  This should suggest to\\npeople that there are reasons other than simply Biblical involved.\\nThis is true on both sides -- clearly homosexual Christians are as\\nstrongly motivated to find ways of discrediting the Biblical arguments\\nas conservative Christians are to find Biblical arguments.  But I\\ncan\\'t help feeling that the Bible is being used by both sides as a way\\nof justifying attitudes which come from other sources.  This is a\\ndangerous situation for Christians.\\n\\nOn the other side of the issue, I would like to note some problems I\\nhave with the pro-homosexual position as it is commonly presented.\\nOne of the most common arguments is that homosexuality is biologically\\ndetermined.  I.e. \"God made me homosexual\", and I have no choice.  I\\nthink \"God made me homosexual\" is a fine view for people who already\\nbelieve on other grounds that homosexuality is acceptable.  But I\\ndon\\'t see it as an argument for acceptability.',\n",

Try rephrasing it:\\n\\n\\tWhat\\'s more important to Christians?  Love of God or love\\n\\tof other human beings?\\n\\nto which of course the only conceivable answer is that the one is like\\nthe other.  I am *deeply* suspicious of any \"flavor\" of Christianity\\nwhich would elevate one clause of the Great Commandment to a \"priority\"\\nover the other such as to claim a conflict.  True, we are told to let\\nthe dead bury the dead, to \"hate\" family rather than let it keep us from\\nfollowing Christ.  But the dichotomy here is not one between love of our\\nfellows and love of God, but of allowing *social* constructs to blind us\\nto the presense of God.  It is particularly satanic to twist love of God\\nin such a manner as to become an excuse to treat others as on a different\\nlevel than the one who is so caught up in \"love\" of God.\\n\\nThe trouble comes in the relation of human love and human sex.  Yes, it\\nhas sometimes been the case that the Church has \"taught\" that all sex\\nwas nasty, evil, sinful stuff.  But when man and wife leave their parental\\nhomes to become helpmates, living in one flesh, it is the sex that is the\\nvehicle of becoming \"one flesh\" (if you doubt me, read St. Paul on what\\nis wrong with frequenting prostitutes :-)).  Less provocatively, what I\\nmean is just this: sexual bonding is a deeply founded aspect of our social\\ninteraction, and in particular is the foundation of the institution of\\nmarriage, so that unlike with many mammals, human males remain with and\\nfoster the children they beget and support their children\\'s mothers.\\nThis is the schema behind Genesis 2:18-24 (and behind Jesus\\' citation of\\nthat passage.)\\n\\n\\t[ I observe, by the way, that not all human males in fact do as\\n\\t  I have just described; but another thing that characterizes\\n\\t  human societies is our raising of *non*begotten children, not\\n\\t  only orphans and adoptees and the like, but products of the\\n\\t  quite common infidelities of humans to their spouses. We are\\n\\t  in this not unique in the animal world, but the full extent of\\n\\t  social consequences and implications is most intricate for us. ]\\n\\nYes, of course it sometimes goes \"wrong\" -- like all else we do, it is\\ninfected with sin, and you find married \"couples\" where there is no bond,\\nand people so deliriously addicted to the initial stages of sexual bond\\nformation (the \"infatuation\", \"falling in love\" phase) that they break\\nany forming bond in order to keep stepping over the threshold of the deep\\nunity God has prepared for us, and stepping back out again right away.\\nSatan may indeed *use* sex as a very handy tool to corrupt human love --\\nbut in the Edenic creation, that is not its nature, and with God\\'s grace\\nunder the power of Christ to make all things new it need not be a problem\\nfor Christians (though we must be vigilant, even in Christ, as the devil\\nis watchful, prowling around like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.)\\n\\nSo, returning to the original question, what is more important to STRAIGHT\\nChristians?  Sex, or Christianity?  Paul, clearly, tended to think that\\nsex was at best a distraction from Christianity (though to be charitable\\nto him, his context was in expectation of immediate parousia, so that the\\nhard TASKS of a married union -- the lifelong building and adaptation to\\neach other -- seemed somehow to undercut the \"proper\" preparation for an\\nimmediate eschaton.  Since we *do not* know the hour of return, we should\\nact *both* with instant readiness for that *and* with a commitiment to our\\nmates that proposes a long lifetime together.  And telling people *not* to\\nbond in such a perspective strikes me as crippling us in the second clause\\nof the the commandment to love.  I would claim that only a very few saints\\nhave the CAPACITY to deeply love (without sexual tinges or complication,\\nmind you) their fellow human beings unless they have had a deeply spiritual\\nlife in married union growing together as one flesh -- and that means in\\nthe type case, with a persistent and continued sexual relationship.  We\\nare human, and little good comes of trying to \"mortify the flesh\" to the\\npoint of pretending to be otherwise, pretending NOT to be sexual beings.\\n\\n\\nIt depends entirely on context.  If that context is major hypocrisy\\non the part of those who find us \"stumbling blocks\" I am much less of\\na mind to efface myself so that they can pontificate about MY sins.\\n\\nThere are some people for whom a life of celibacy is a spritual gift,\\nand maybe even a victory against a to-them troubling sexual urge that\\nseems to them to lead only to sin.  Nothing I say should ever be read\\nas demeaning such a gift.  Nor the even rarer gift of love for all our\\nconspecifics, and indeed for all God\\'s creation, that can develop to\\nthe full *without* the tutoring of a spousal/helpmate marriage founded\\nin sex.  But there is a difference between spiritual gifts and penance;\\ntelling people that they HAVE to have a particular gift (or else? what?)\\nis fraught with manipulation and disregard of the differences of our\\nspiritual endowments from God.  To one person is given the gift of\\nspeaking in toungues, to another intepretation of toungues; to yet\\nanother prophecy; and to still another teaching.  The notion that some\\n*particular* gift is required of *all* is one of the earliest heresies.',\n",

       " '[cont. Dr. James DeYoung; #3]\\n\\nR. Scroggs\\n\\n     Robin Scroggs has built upon the discussion of his predecessors and\\nsuggested a new twist to the word.  Scroggs believes that arsenokoitai is a\\n\"Hellenistic Jewish coinage, perhaps influenced by awareness of rabbinic\\nterminology.\"  The term is derived from Lev 18\"22 & 20:13 where the LXX\\njuxtaposes the two words arsenos (\"male\") and koiten (\"bed\"), and represents\\nthe Hebrew miskab zabar (\"lying with a male\").   Yet he believes that Paul did\\nnot originate the term, but borrowed it from \"circles of Hellenistic Jews\\nacquainted with rabbinic discussions\" (180 n.14).  It was invented to avoid\\n\"contact with the usual Greek terminology\" (108).  If this is true, Scroggs\\nobserves, it explains why the word does not appear in Greco-Roman discussions\\nof pederasty and why later patristic writers avoided it.  It was meaningless to\\nnative-speaking Greeks (108).\\n\\n     Scroggs takes the second part as the active word and the first word as the\\nobject of the second part, thus differing from Boswell\\'s \"learned discussion\"\\n(107).  Yet Scroggs understands the general meaning of \"one who lies with a\\nmale\" to have a very narrow reference.  With the preceding malokoi (I Cor 6:9),\\nwhich Scroggs interprets as \"the effeminate call-boy,\" arsenokoitai is the\\nactive partner \"who keeps the malakos of the \\'mistress\\' or who hires him on\\noccasion to satisfy his sexual desires\" (108).  Hence arsenokoitai does not\\nrefer to homosexuality in general, to female homosexuality, or to the generic\\nmodel of pederasty.  It certainly cannot refer to the modern gay model, he\\naffirms (109).\\n     This is Scrogg\\'s interpretation of the term in I Tim 1:10 also.  The\\ncombination of pornoi (\"fornicators\"), arsenokoitai and andrapodistai (\"slave\\ndealers\") refers to \"male prostitutes, males who lie [with them], and slave\\ndealers [who procure them]\" (120).  It again refers to that  specific form of\\npederasty \"which consisted of the enslaving of boys as youths for sexual\\npurposes, and the use of these boys by adult males\" (121).  Even \"serious\\nminded pagan authors\" condemned this form of pederasty.  He then uses these\\ninstances of arsenokoitai in I Cor and I Tim to interpret the apparently\\ngeneral condemnation of both female and male homosexuality in Rom 1. \\nConsequently Paul \"Must have had, could only have had pederasty in mind\" (122).\\nWe cannot know what Paul would have said about the \"contemporary model of\\nadult/adult mutuality in same sex relation ships\" (122).\\n\\n     In relating these terms to the context and to contemporary ethical\\nconcerns, Scroggs emphasizes the point that the specific items in the list of\\nvices in I Cor 6 have no deliberate, intended meaning in Paul.  The form and\\nfunction of the catalogue of vices are traditional and stereotyped.  Any\\nrelationship between an individual item in the list and the context was usually\\nnonexistent.  He concludes that Paul \"does not care about any specific item in\\nthe lists\" (104). \\n\\n     Both on the basis of the meaning of the terms and of the literary\\nphenomenon of a \"catalogue of vices,\"  Scroggs argues that the Scriptures are\\n\"irrelevant and provide no help in the heated debate today\" (129).  The \"model\\nin today\\'s Christian homosexual community is so different from the model\\nattacked by the NT\" that \"Biblical judgments against homosexuality are not\\nrelevant to today\\'s debate.  They should no longer be used in denominational\\ndiscussions about homosexuality, should in no way be a weapon to justify\\nrefusal of ordination. . . \" (127).\\n\\n      REACTIONS TO THE NEW INTERPRETATIONS OF ARSENOKOITAI\\n\\nD. Wright\\n\\n     In more recent years the positions of Bailey, Boswell, and Scroggs have\\ncome under closer scrutiny.   Perhaps the most critical evaluation of Boswell\\'s\\nview is that by David Wright.  In his thorough article, Wright points out\\nseveral shortcomings of Boswell\\'s treatment of arsenokoitai.   He faults\\nBoswell for failing to cite, or citing inaccurately, all the references to Lev\\n18:22 and 20:13 in the church fathers, such as Eusebius, the \"Apostolic\\nConstitutions,\"  Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian and Origen (127-28). \\nBoswell has not considered seriously enough the possibility that the term\\nderives either its form or its meaning from the Leviticus passages (129).  This\\nis significant, for if the term is so derived, it clearly refutes Boswell\\'s\\nclaim that the first half of the word (arseno-) denotes not the object but the\\ngender of the second half (-koitai).  The LXX must mean \"a male who sleeps with\\na male,\" making arseno- the object.\\n\\n     Wright also faults Boswell\\'s claims regarding linguistic features of the\\nterm, including suggested parallels (129).  Though Boswell claims that\\ncompounds with arseno- employ it objectively and those with arreno- employ it\\nas an adjective, Wright believes that the difference between the two is merely\\none of dialectical diversity: \"No semantic import attaches to the difference\\nbetween the two forms\" (131).  Wright believes that in most compounds in which\\nthe second half is a verb or has a verbal force, the first half denotes its\\nobject and where \"the second part is substantival, the first half denotes its\\ngender\" (132). \\n\\n     It is with Boswell\\'s treatment of the early church fathers that Wright\\ntakes special issue, because the former has failed to cite all the sources. \\nFor example, Aristides\\' Apology (c. AD 138) probably uses arrenomaneis,\\nandrobaten, and arsenokoitias all with the same basic meaning of male\\nhomosexuality (133), contrary to Boswell\\'s discussion.  Boswell fails to cite\\nHippolytus (Refut. Omn. Haer. 5:26:22-23) and improperly cites Eusebius and the\\nSyriac writer Bardensanes.  The latter uses Syriac terms that are identical to\\nthe Syriac of I Cor 6:9 and I Tim 1:10 (133-34). \\n\\n     Next Wright shows how the early church fathers use arsenokoitai in\\nparallel with paidophthoria referring to male homosexuality with teenagers, the\\ndominant form of male homosexuality among the Greeks (134).  Sometimes this\\nparallelism occurs in the threefold listings of moicheia (\"adultery\"), porneia\\n(\"fornication\"), and paidophthoria, with arsenokoitai replacing paidophthoris\\n(136).  Clement of Alexandria in Protr. 10:108:5 cites the second table of the\\nTen Commandments as \"You shall not kill, ou moicheuseis (\"you shall not commit\\nadultery\"), ou paidophthoreseis (\"you shall not practice homosexuality with\\nboys\"), you shall not steal. . .\" (150 n. 43).\\n\\n     Another occurrence of arsenokoitein (\"commit homosexuality\") exists in the\\nSibylline Oracles 2:71-73.  It may be, Wright observes, that the word was\\ncoined by a Jewish pre-Christian writer in a Hellenistic setting represented by\\nOr.Sib., book 2 (137-38).\\n\\n     Wright also discusses uses of arsenokoitai in Rhetorius (6th c.) who drew\\nupon the first century AD writer Teucer, in Macarius (4th-5th c.), and in John\\nthe Faster (d. 595) (139-40).  The last in particular bears the idea of\\nhomosexual intercourse, contrary to Boswell.\\n\\n     Wright next replies to Boswell\\'s contention that the term would not be\\nabsent \"from so much literature about homosexuality if that is what it denoted\\n(140-41).  Wright points out that it should not be expected in writers prior to\\nthe first century AD since it did not exist before then, that the Greeks used\\ndozens of words and phrases to refer to homosexuality, that some sources (e.g.\\nDidache) show no acquaintance with Paul\\'s letters or deliberately avoid citing\\nScripture, and that Boswell neglects citing several church fathers (140-41). \\n\\n     Boswell\\'s treatment of Chrysostom in particular draws Wright\\'s attention\\n(141-44).  Boswell conspicuously misrepresents the witness of Chrysostom,\\nomitting references and asserting what is patently untrue.  Chrysostom gives a\\nlong uncompromising and clear indictment of homosexuality in his homily on Rom\\n1:26.  Boswell has exaggerated Chrysostom\\'s infrequent use of the term.  Wright\\nobserves that Boswell has \"signally failed to demonstrate any us of\\narsenokoites etc. in which it patently does not denote male homosexual\\nactivity\" (144).  It is infrequent because of its relatively technical nature\\nand the availability of such a term as paidophthoria that more clearly\\nspecified the prevailing form of male homosexuality in the Greco-Roman world. \\n\\n     Wright also surveys the Latin, Syriac, and Coptic translations of I Tim\\nand I Cor.  All three render arsenokoitai with words that reflect the meaning\\n\"homosexual\" i.e., they understand arseno- as the object of the second half of\\nthe word (144-45).  None of these primary versions supports Boswell\\'s limited\\nconclusion based on them.\\n\\n     Wright concludes his discussion with a few observations about the\\ncatalogues of vices as a literary form.  He believes that such lists developed\\nin late Judaism as Hellenistic Jews wrote in clear condemnation of\\nhomosexuality in the Greek world.  This paralleled the increased concern on the\\npart of moral philosophers over homosexual indulgence.  The term came into\\nbeing under the influence of the LXX (145) so that writers spoke \"generally of\\nmale activity with males rather than specifically categorized male sexual\\nengagement with paides\" (146).  If arsenokoitai and paidophthoria were\\ninterchangeable, it is because the former encompassed the latter (146).\\n\\n     In summary, Wright seeks to show that arsenokoitai is a broad term meaning\\nhomosexuality and arises with Judaism.   The views of Boswell, Scroggs, and\\nothers who limit the term to \"active male prostitutes\" or pederasty are without\\nsignificant support from linguistic and historical studies.  ',\n",

Of course the apocryphal books were received (by some),\\ncollected (or else we would not have them), read and used (and they still are,\\nin the Catholic and Orthodox churches).\\n\\n: On these counts, the apocrapha falls short of the glory of God.\\n\\nThis is demonstrably false.\\n\\n: To quote Unger\\'s Bible Dictionary on the Apocrapha:\\n: 1. They abound in historical and geographical inaccuracies and\\n: anachronisms.\\n\\nSo do other books of the Bible.\\n\\n: 2. They teach doctrines which are false and foster practices\\n: which are at variance with sacred Scripture.\\n\\n\"False\" by whose interpretation?  Those churches that accept them find no\\ncontradiction with the rest of scripture.  \\n\\n: 3. They resort to literary types and display an artificiality of\\n: subject matter and styling out of keeping with sacred Scripture.\\n\\nThis is a purely subjective evaluation.  The apocryphal books demonstrate\\nthe same categories and forms of writing found in the other scriptures.\\n(In fact, one could argue that the apocryphal \"Additions to the Book of\\nEsther\" act rather to bring the \"unscripturelike\" book of Esther more into\\nline with other books.)\\n\\n: 4. They lack the distinctive elements which give genuine\\n: Scripture their divine character, such as prophetic power and\\n: poetic and religious feeling.\\n\\nHave you ever read the Wisdom of Ben Sira or the Wisdom of Solomon?  They\\nexhibit every bit as much \"poetic and religious feeling\" as Psalms or\\nProverbs.\\n\\n[deletions]\\n\\n: How do you then view the words: \"I warn everyone who  hears the\\n: words of the prophecy of this book: If anyone adds anything to\\n: them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book.\\n: And if anyone takes away from this book the prophecy, God will\\n: take away from him his share in the tree of life and in the\\n: holy city\" (Rev 22.18-9)\\n: Surely this sets the standard and not just man-made traditions.\\n\\nThese words clearly were meant to refer to the book of Revelation alone,\\nnot to the whole body of scripture.  Revelation itself was accepted very\\nlate into the canon.  The church simply did not see it as having a primary\\nrole of any kind in identifying and limiting scripture.\\n\\n: It is also noteworthy to consider Jesus\\' attitude. He had no\\n: argument with the pharisees over any of the OT canon (John\\n: 10.31-6), and explained to his followers on the road to Emmaus \\n: that in the law, prophets and psalms which referred to him - the \\n: OT division of Scripture (Luke 24.44), as well as in Luke 11.51\\n: taking Genesis to Chronicles (the jewish order - we would say\\n: Genesis to Malachi) as Scripture.\\n\\nJesus does not refer to the canon for the simple reason that in his day,\\nthe canon had not been established as a closed collection.  The books\\nof the apocrypha were part of the Septuagint (which was the Bible of\\nthe early church).  The Hebrew canon was not closed until 90 c.e.\\nThe Torah (Pentateuch/ \"Law\") was established in Jesus\\' day, as were\\nthe Prophets (with the _exclusion_ of Daniel).  The Writings, however,\\nwere still in flux.  Jesus does not refer to the Writings, only to the\\nPsalms, which were part of them.  The books of the apocrypha were all\\npart of the literature that was eventually sifted and separated.\\n\\nTo argue that Jesus is referring to the Jewish canonical order in Luke 11:51\\nis weak at best; he is not quoting scripture, but telling a chronological\\nstory.  And, as mentioned above, the Hebrew canon (especially in the\\npresent order) did not exist as such in Jesus\\' day.',\n",

       " 'Meta-exegesis: Conviction of Sin,  part II\\n\\nLet me return to the question, stipulating that Paul meant his use of\\n_arseonkoitai_ to refer more or less exactly to the Levitical prohibition\\nof male-male sex.  In order to bring out the problems most clearly, I\\'ll\\nalso stipulate (what I think is far less plausible) that Paul coined the\\nterm for this usage.  The question I want to turn to is what that would\\nmean for Paul\\'s readers and for later Christians.  This should be shorter\\nthan my last note, as we will see that this question rapidly confronts us\\nwith some of the major divisions within Christ\\'s body, and I am not trying\\nto open the gates for flames across any of the terrible chasms that\\nseparate any of us from our fellow Christians.  My own biases (loosely\\ncharacterizable as \"liberal\") will be evident, but I am not grinding an\\naxe here, so much as trying to get all parties to see that it may be HARD\\nto reach \"closure\" when the issues involved strike at the heart of what we\\neach, in our own different ways, see as crucial to the Gospel of Christ.\\n\\nSo; stipulating Paul\\'s intent, the immediate question is: HOW CAN HIS\\nREADERS UNDERSTAND this intent?  And following on that question, there is\\na second one: WHAT IS OUR PROPER ACTION if we *do* manage to understand him?\\n\\nSince Paul gives not a single clue about his meaning in the text of 1st\\nCorinthians, there are two \"positive\" answers and one \"negative\" to this\\nquestion:\\n\\n+\\ta.  Paul (or Apollos, or someone) in the apostolic community has\\n\\t    conveyed to the Corinthians the then-traditional Jewish condem-\\n\\t    nation of homosexual behavior, and Paul expects them to be\\n\\t    sufficiently well-tutored by this tradition that he needs no\\n\\t    futher explanation.  [I should note that there is no evidence\\n\\t    in the letter, or in 2 Corinthians for such a supposition :-)]\\n\\n+\\tb.  The Spirit will teach us what Paul means (or, if not Paul,\\n\\t    what God means \"behind\" Paul\\'s inspired word-choice.)\\n\\n-\\tc.  We *don\\'t* know, and cannot guess to within any better pre-\\n\\t    cision here than, for comparison, in the parallel use by Paul,\\n\\t    in the same passage of the word  _pleonektai_ (\"those who have\\n\\t    more\" -- if you think that _areseonkoitai_ is \"obvious\" from\\n\\t    its roots, try cutting your teeth on *this* word!  The NEB\\n\\t    translates it as \"grabbers\") or even _methusoi_ (\"drunkards\"\\n\\t    -- at least this has the advantage of being a common insult,\\n\\t    so that at least there is *some* hint as to its meaning!)\\n\\nThe three positions more or less -- if I can be allowed some exaggeration\\nfor the sake of argument -- define a classical Catholic attitude towards\\ntradition, one form of Protestant _sola scriptura_, and a liberal/critical\\ndemand for evidence.  All three positions have strengths and weaknesses.\\n\\n_ad_ a:\\tIt is unquestionable that the gospel was preached in and by the\\n\\tcommunity of Christ\\'s disciples and their successors, and that\\n\\tour NT scripture itself emerges from this communal tradition.\\n\\tBut it\\'s also the case that we know little or nothing about this\\n\\ttradition until almost a century after Paul, which is to say that\\n\\twe have access to the tradition only after several generations of\\n\\tpossibly confused transmission.  The scripture is itself our only\\n\\tdocumentation of the tradition in the critical era.\\n\\n_ad_ b:\\tIf we are NOT born of water and Spirit [to revert to John in an\\n\\tattempt to explain Paul :-)], then we have no more hope of under-\\n\\tstanding the gospel than Nicodemus had; neither the traditions of\\n\\tmen nor the vain elevation of our own reason can prevent the Spirit\\n\\tfrom blowing where it will -- the Paraclete is a kamikaze.  But\\n\\tthe downside of Protestant belief in the efficacy of the Spirit\\n\\tas our guide in scripture is that the wing of Protestantism that\\n\\ttakes this most seriously is also the most fragmented over divergent\\n\\tunderstanding supposedly derived from the \"clear\" Word of God.\\n\\n\\t\\t[Note: classical Lutheran, Calvinist and Anglican thought\\n\\t\\tconstrains scripture to be read *within* tradition, even\\n\\t\\twhile reserving judgment against tradition out of scripture;\\n\\t\\tthe more bizarre forms of \"I will read Scripture my way\"\\n\\t\\tare primarily a fringe aspect of \"cultic\" Protestantism.]\\n\\n\\tThe main problem with this approach is that there is apparently no\\n\\tmeans for ONE person to convey to another what that one may feel\\n\\t*is* teaching received from the Spirit; and history shows incredible\\n\\tconflict between Christians on this point, each in his own mind\\n\\t\"convinced\" that he is led by the Spirit.  No one can seriously\\n\\turge point b without SOME sense of its potential for setting Christian\\n\\tagainst Christian.  To what purpose?\\n\\n_ad_ c:\\tThe critical approach has the distinct advantage that when it can\\n\\treach a conclusion, it can lay out the data in a way which is open\\n\\tto all.  The weakness is an obvious corollary: this is not usually\\n\\tpossible. :-)\\n\\n\\t[If I may say a word here, out of my own already acknowledged bias;\\n\\tone complaint against critical methodology is that it \"dissolves\"\\n\\tfaith -- but surely a \"faith\" that cannot honestly face the evalu-\\n\\tation of evidence has problems which mere theology is helpless to\\n\\taddress.]\\n\\nAnyway, there is a serious and unfortunate possibility of schism between\\n\"liberal\" and \"conservative\" positions, mostly on the basis of extreme\\nzealots of positions b and c.  A Catholic sense of authority and tradition\\ntends to constrain arguments of b contra c to secondary position, so that\\ndespite horrendous strains Rome is NOT as likely to find these issues as\\nultimately divisive as the Protestant world will.  And Anglicans will (I\\npredict) muddle through on the _via media_, attempting to give each position\\nits due, but no more than its due. \\n\\nSecond question.  Suppose tradition tells us, and lots of \"spiritual\"\\nChristians tell us, and critical thought at least admits as possible,\\nthat Paul is refering to a flat, universal Levitical prohibition against\\nmale-male sex.  What then?  Again, we can abdicate our personal responsi-\\nbility to tradition, and let it dictate the answer.  But it\\'s precisely\\nwhere inherited traditions are NOT questioned that they\\'re most dangerous.\\n\\nWe have EXAMPLES of Christ questioning the Pharisees and THEIR use of\\ntradition (despite his urging, in Matthew 23:2 that we are to heed them).\\nWe have EXAMPLES of Peter, and more radically still Paul, jettisoning the\\ntraditions that THEY were led by the Spirit to call into question.  Jesus\\nand Peter and Paul do not so much \"throw out\" tradition as subject it to\\nradical criticism, on a couple of very basic grounds:\\n\\n     \"the weightier demands of the law: justice and mercy and good faith\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Matthew 23:23)\\nand  \"On these two commandments [love God & neighbor] hand the whole Law,\\n      and the Prophets, also.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t(Matthew 22:40)\\n\\nIf there is a fundamental (because derived from Christ) validity in the\\nchallenge to *some* traditions, a validity that led the first generation\\nto go so far as to waive application of the Torah to gentile converts\\n(vastly beyond anything that is directly deducible from Jesus\\' reported\\nwords and deeds), it signifies to me a certain failure of the imagination\\nto *postulate* that *only* the traditions that we have specific challenges\\nagainst are in fact open to challenge.\\n\\nAll traditions passed *through* men are traditions *of* men.  That God may\\nlead us even so, that these traditions are a source of our spiritual\\ninstruction I will freely grant.  But tradition is inherently human, and\\ninherently corruptible (and given the Fall, corrupt).  Nothing in it is\\nimmune to challenge, when the Spirit shows us a failure in justice, mercy\\nand good faith.  Nothing may ultimately stand unless it DOES follow from\\nlove of God and love of neighbor.\\n\\nI am perfectly willing to grant that I could be blind to my own sin.  That\\nthe Spirit may have taught another what She refuses to teach me (or I am\\ntoo dense to learn).  That tradition *might* have value here.  But what I\\n*know* of tradition is that on one occasion, some superstitious Christians\\nappealed to Justinian after an earthquake in Asia Minor, and scapegoated\\n\"sodomites\" as the \"cause\" of the earthquake, so that legislation was\\npassed making homosexual behavior a capital offense.  If that is in\\naccord with the gospel of Christ, then I am no Christian.  That is human\\ntradition at its most hateful and vicious.  And I see nothing all that much\\ndifferent in all the unbidden eruptions onto USENET of people who are quick\\nto condemn but slow to understand.  If that is the leading of the Spirit,\\nthen I want no part of it.  But what I have found in obedience to the Lord\\nis that I am, myself, TOTALLY dependent on the witness of other Christians,\\nfor the truth that lives in the Body of Christ.\\n\\nAnd I say to all who doubt that gay Christianity is from God what Gamaliel\\nsaid to doubting Pharisees who would have suppressed the earliest Church:\\n\\n\\t\"be careful how you deal with these people...  If this enterprise,\\n\\tthis movement of theirs, is of human origin it will break up of\\n\\tits own accord; but if it does in fact come from God you will not\\n\\tonly be unable to destroy them, but you might find yourselves\\n\\tfighting against God.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t[Acts 5:36...39] \\n\\nAll I ask is that you listen to your traditions, and read your scriptures\\nwith a mind and soul OPEN to the Spirit, and to the past history of our\\nfirst Christian witnesses\\' willingness to challenge tradition and OTHER\\nreadings of scripture -- though read with all the authority of scribes and\\nrabbis -- and a submission to the declaration that all must depend on the\\nlove of God and neighbor.  Then, study the evidence; learn the history of\\nChristians oppressing Christians out of their traditions and eagerness to\\njudge where Jesus and Paul tell us NOT to judge.  And let the witness of\\nthe Spirit in the lives of your fellow Christians -- including those who\\nare NOT of your preference in theology -- guide you towards God\\'s truth.\\n-- \\nMichael L.

I think\\nthere are two ways to use tradition.  One is to say that when Paul and\\nhis readers share a tradition, it makes sense to interpret his words\\nin the context of that shared tradition.  That\\'s what makes me think\\nthat these arguments over words turn out to be silly.  We know that\\nPaul came out of a background that was rather Puritanical on sex.\\nEverything else he says on sex is consistent with that background.\\nThe tone of his remarks on homosexuality in Rom 1 is consistent with\\nthat background.  Even if the words in the sin lists aren\\'t the most\\ngeneral terms for homosexual activity (and it seems to me that there\\'s\\nsome evidence that they are not), they are just one more piece of\\nevidence for something we would probably be willing to believe with no\\nevidence at all -- that Paul shares the common Jewish rejection of\\nhomosexuality.\\n\\nBut when you identify (a) with the Catholic position, that\\'s rather a\\nhorse of a different color.  The Catholic position involves a\\ncontinuing church tradition.  Arguments specific to that tradition\\nmight be (1) we can get guidance on how to interpret Paul\\'s original\\nmeaning from tradition, e.g. the way the Church Fathers interpreted\\nhim, and (2) we gain confidence that his prohibitions still apply in\\nour time because of the universal judgement of the church between his\\ntime and ours.  I think this is a somewhat different use of tradition.\\nA radical Protestant might be willing to use known 1st Cent.\\ntradition to illuminate Paul\\'s original meaning, but not use the\\nCatholic position to answer the question of what our own attitude to\\nhomosexuality should be.',\n",

       " 'Some  people working a few cubes over have come up with this need, and\\nit seems that someone out there just might have done it  already,  and\\ncan point me to some tools that would help. What they\\'d like to do is:\\nGiven a window that is taking a long time to draw (because either  the\\ndata  is  arriving  over a slow link, or the $DISPLAY is across a slow\\nlink), they would like to first paint a low-resolution version of  the\\npicture,  and then repaint it in higher resolution.  Thus, the picture\\nmight first be generated in 1/4 resolution, with each  4x4  square  of\\npixels  being  filled  in  with a single color.  Next, each 4x4 square\\nwould be replaced by 4 2x2 squares; finally the 1x1 version  would  be\\npainted.\\n\\nSince  one of the scenarios is with the window being on the other side\\nof a slow link, the low-res version obviously wouldn\\'t be  transmitted\\nas  a bitmap; that wouldn\\'t help at all.  Instead, there would have to\\nbe a process on the far end that receives the  low-res  picture  as  a\\nsmall  bitmap,  and  blows up each pixel into a square (sorta like the\\nmagnifier programs do).  This brings up the question of whether the  X\\nserver  can help.  That is, when a window is opened, is there a way to\\nask that a \"filter\" program be run to process the pixels?  Or  is  the\\nonly  way  to  use  something  like  rsh  to start up a remote process\\n(\"Permission denied\" ;-), and have it open a local window?\\n\\nIt seems the most likely scenario is a library routine that starts  up\\nsuch  a  program  remotely, and then accepts bitmaps, compressing each\\none by some amount, and sending them to the remote program to  expand.\\nBut  if  there is something that X itself can do to help, it\\'s be nice\\nto hear about it.

I say those who are not saved are not\\nsaved on account of their own sins.  It is not because God did not give\\nthem sufficient grace, for He does do so, in His desire that all men\\nmight be saved.  However, as only some are saved - and those who are\\nsaved are saved by the grace of God, \"not by works, lest any man should\\nboast\" - the others are damned because of their obstinacy in refusing to\\nheed the call of God.  They are damned by their own free will and\\nchosing, a choice forseen by God in His causing them to be not\\npredestined, but reprobated instead.\\n\\n\\nCertainly God does not distribute grace evenly.  If He did, no one could\\nhave their heart hardened (or rather, harden their heart, thus causing\\nGod to withdraw His grace).  But, you are correct - the world is divided\\ninto those who God knows to be saved, and those God knows to be on the\\nroad to perdition.  THe key is that God knows it and we do not.  Thus,\\nno one can boast in complete assurance that they are one of the elect\\nand predestined.  But no one who is a Christian in good standin should\\ndoubt their salvation either (that shows a lack of trust in God).\\n\\n\\nYou must admit it is possible.  Anyway, why would you want something in\\nthe hear and know, when you can recieve 100 fold in heaven?  Better to\\nlay up your treasure in heaven is what Jesus said.\\nThis is not to condemn the rich, but simply to point out that those who\\nare rich are frequently very evil or immoral, so God must give them\\ntheir blessing know, as they have chosen.  Remeber, Jesus promised\\ntribulation in this world, and hatred of others because we are\\nChristians.  He did not promise heaven on earth.  He promised heaven.\\n\\n\\nNot really.  Unless you do penance here on earth, you will have to do it\\nin Purgatory, as Paul pointed out (1 Corinthians 3.15).  Those with\\npoorer works, though still done with good intentions, will only be saved\\nthrough fire (the damned will of course go into fire immeadiately, for\\nwhatever good they did was not for God but for self (dead works)).  Of\\ncourse, the Church gives indulgences, has Confession, and Annointing of\\nthe Sick to remove sin and the the vestiges of sin, so there is really\\nlittle excuse for ending up in Purgatory - it is a last hope for the\\nsomewhat lazy and careless as I said above in referring to Paul.\\n\\nAnd no comments were taken as flames.

Juan\\'s probably the victim of pitching staff,\\nfluke shots, and a monster park factor.  But let\\'s put it this way:  If we\\nreplaced every centerfielder in the league with someone with Kevin\\'s 55.4% out\\nmaking ability, how many extra hits would go by?\\n\\nTo try and correlate it to reality a little more, I\\'ve calculated Net\\nHits Stolen, based on the number of outs made compared to what a league\\naverage fielder would make.  By the same method I\\'ve calculated Net Extra \\nBases (doubles and triples let by).\\n\\nFinally, I throw all this into a a formula I call Defensive Contribution, or\\nDCON :->.  Basically, it represents the defensive contribution of a player.\\nI add this number to OPS to get DOPS (Defense + Onbase Plus Slug), which\\nshould represent the player\\'s total contribution to the team.  So don\\'t\\ntake it too seriously.  The formula for DCON appears at the end of this\\narticle.\\n\\nThe short version -- definition of terms\\nHS -- Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to Kurt Stillwell\\nNHS -- Net Hits Stolen -- Extra outs compared to average fielder\\nNDP -- Net Double Plays -- Extra double plays turned compared to avg fielder\\nNEB -- Net Extra Bases --  Extra bases prevented compared to avg. fielder\\nDCON -- Defensive Contribution -- bases and hits prevented, as a rate.\\nDOPS -- DCON + OPS -- quick & dirty measure of player\\'s total contribution.\\n\\nNational League\\n\\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nNixon, O.       34    12    15   .083    .777\\nGrissom, M.     48    18    12   .072    .812\\nJackson, D.     46    13    20   .060    .735\\nLewis, D.       25     8    -6   .029    .596\\nDykstra, L.     25     5    -5   .013    .794\\nDascenzo, D.    10    -5    10   .001    .616\\nFinley, S.      32    -2     2  -.003    .759\\nLankford, R.    39     4   -12  -.007    .844\\nMartinez, D.    21     5   -16  -.017    .660\\nVanSlyke, A.    30    -4   -17  -.040    .846\\nSanders, R.      7   -10    -4  -.059    .759\\nButler, B.       1   -29     5  -.088    .716\\nJohnson, H.      3   -12   -19  -.118    .548\\n\\nOrdered by DOPS\\n\\n.846 VanSlyke\\n.844 Lankford\\n.812 Grissom\\n.794 Dykstra\\n.777 Nixon\\n.759 Finley\\n.759 Sanders\\n.735 Jackson\\n.730 *NL Average*\\n.716 Butler\\n.660 Martinez\\n.616 Dascenzo\\n.596 Lewis\\n.548 Johnson\\n\\nAmerican League\\n---------------\\n\\nName            HS   NHS   NEB   DCON    DOPS\\nLofton, K.      57    32    17   .220    .947\\nWilson, W.      47    26     0   .125    .787\\nWhite, D.       52    25    28   .119    .812\\nFelix, J.       22     0    32   .063    .713\\nDevereaux, M.   43    16     0   .047    .832\\nMcRae, H.       38    11    -1   .038    .631\\nYount, R.       31     8    -3   .022    .737\\nKelly, R.       13    -6    -3  -.025    .681\\nJohnson, L.     23    -5   -13  -.040    .641\\nGriffey, K.     15    -9   -12  -.052    .844\\nPuckett, K.     13   -13   -15  -.063    .801\\nCuyler, M.       6   -10    -6  -.088    .503\\nGonzalez, J.     0   -21   -15  -.095    .738\\n\\n\\nOrder by DOPS\\n\\n.947 Lofton\\n.844 Griffey\\n.832 Devereaux\\n.812 White\\n.801 Puckett\\n.787 Wilson\\n.738 Gonzalez\\n.737 Yount\\n.713 Felix\\n.709 *AL Average*\\n.681 Kelly\\n.641 Johnson\\n.631 McRae\\n.503 Cuyler\\n\\nMore discussion --\\n\\nDCON formula:  ((NHS + NDP)/PA) + ((NHS + NDP + NEB)/AB)\\nWhy such a bizzare formula?

       " 'David Hammerslag asked:\\n\\n\\tHow do you (Mormons) reconcile the idea of eternal marriage\\n\\twith Christ\\'s statement that in the resurrection people will\\n\\tneither marry nor be given in marriage (Luke, chapt. 20)?\\n\\nSeveral explanations for this seeming contradiction have been proposed,\\nbut most LDS scholars whose opinions I have studied take more or less\\none of the following three positions:\\n\\n(1) Jesus was talking to a group of people (Sadducees) who were trying\\n    to trip Him up with what they felt was a silly hypothetical situa-\\n    tion that ridiculed the concept of a resurrection (something they\\n    didn\\'t believe in).  These people -- and those associated with them\\n    (\"Now there were with us seven brethren\", Matt. 22:25) -- would not\\n    be receptive to such higher blessings as eternal marriage.  Hence,\\n    the people in the story would likely not be married in the eterni-\\n    ties; but that doesn\\'t mean other, more faithful people could not\\n    have this blessing.\\n\\n(2) Jesus was making a distinction between the state or condition of\\n    =being= married, and the process of =becoming= married.  The latter\\n    activity (marrying and giving in marriage) will not take place in\\n    the eternities, because all eternal marriages will be taken care of\\n    before then.\\n\\n(3) The account as we have it (in all three of the synoptic Gospels) is\\n    missing something that would make its real meaning clearer.  Note\\n    that we (LDS) do not believe in Biblical inerrancy, so we do not in\\n    general feel obliged to reconcile each and every Bible text with\\n    modern revelation through Joseph Smith and other latter-day proph-\\n    ets.  Nor are we particularly upset that the account in question\\n    was not significantly revised in the \"Joseph Smith Translation\" or\\n    \"Inspired Version\" of the Bible, since we do not believe this work\\n    was completed or that failure to revise a passage in the JST con-\\n    stitutes divine approval of that passage as it stands in the KJV.\\n',\n",

Both  families\\nconfess that the Logos, the Second Person  of the Holy  Trinity, only begotten\\nof the Father before the ages  and consubstantial with  Him, was incarnate and\\nwas born from the Virgin Mary Theotokos; fully consubstantial with us, perfect\\nman with soul, body and mind  ($  \\\\nu o  \\\\upsilon \\\\zeta $); He  was crucified,\\ndied, was  buried and rose  from the dead on  the third day, ascended   to the\\nHeavenly Father, where He sits on the right hand of the Father as  Lord of all\\ncreation. At  Pentecost, by the coming of  the  Holy Spirit He  manifested the\\nChurch as His Body. We look forward to His coming again in the fullness of His\\nglory, according to the Scriptures.\\n\\n2. Both  families condemn the  Nestorian heresy and the crypto-Nestorianism of\\nTheodoret of  Cyrus. They agree that it  is not sufficient merely  to say that\\nChrist is consubstantial both with His Father  and with us, by  nature God and\\nby nature man; it is necessary to affirm also that the Logos, Who is by nature\\nGod,  became by  nature   man, by His  incarnation  in the fullness  of  time.\\n\\n3. Both families agree  that the Hypostasis of the  Logos became  composite by\\nuniting to His divine uncreated nature with its natural will and energy, which\\nHe has  in common with  the Father and  the Holy Spirit, created human nature,\\nwhich He assumed  at the Incarnation  and made  His own, with its natural will\\nand energy.\\n\\n4. Both families agree  that the natures  with their proper energies and wills\\n   ^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nare united hypostatically and  naturally   without confusion, without  change,\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nwithout  division and without separation,  and that they are distinguished  in\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\nthought alone.\\n^^^^^^^^^^^^^\\n\\n5.

The problem I find here is not so much\\nparental consent as that there was nobody's consent.  Whether you\\nbelieve in infant baptism or not, baptism is supposed to be the sign\\nof entry into a Christian community.  If there isn't a commitment from\\n*somebody*, whether parent or child, and no intent to become part of\\nthe Church, the baptism appears to be a lie.  Furthermore, it is\\nlikely to raise serious practical problems.  What if the child is from\\na baptist tradition?  Normally when he reaches the age of decision, he\\nwould be expected to make a decision and be baptized.  But he already\\nhas been, by a church claiming to be a Baptist church.

       " \"Yes - Everyone seems to be in agreement that the Yankees are \\nfinally moving in the right direction.  They should finish\\nover .500 this year and maybe even be in the pennent race \\nin August.  However, I would take back a few moves:\\n\\n1.  The Jim Abbott Trade.\\n    I think Abbott is not only an inspirational person, but a\\n    great pitcher also.  He could win the Cy Young this year, \\n    but he won't because the right side of the Yanks infield\\n    isn't good enough.  So why was this not a good trade?  \\n    JT Snow.  How many rookies have been able to step in and\\n    immediately have the impact that he has had so far on \\n    the Angels?  I know it's early, but if you've seen this kid\\n    hit, field or talk you can just tell that he is going to be \\n    a tremendous player.  The Yanks should have kept him.  What\\n    about Mattingly, you ask?  Well - it's great that the Yanks\\n    have taken care of him and remained loyal, but he's 10 years\\n    older than Snow and just doesn't have the same bat speed as\\n    before his back injury.  It's a shame, but as a Yankee fan \\n    who wants to see the *best* Yankee team, I'd take \\n    Snow over Mattingly at first.  The Yanks also gave up two\\n    promising propects with Snow for Abbott.  Besides, with\\n    Domingo Jean, Brien taylor, Wickman, Militello, and Sterling\\n    Hitchcock, they are just loaded with propects.  I know Abbotts\\n    only 26, but this was too much to give up.  I believe George\\n    forced this trade because he believes (and he's right) that\\n    Abbott will be a big hit in NY.  However, I'd like to see the\\n    Yankees build a baseball team, not an amusement show.\\n\\n2.  Wade Boggs.\\n    I live in Boston and like Wade a lot.  But, his career is \\n    winding down and I would rather see the Yanks start to develop\\n    a long term solution (i.e. Hensley Muelins, Russ Davis, Velarde?).\\n    Besides, Wade just doesn't have any range.  What a shame about\\n    Charlie Hayes, huh?\\n\\n3.  Spike Owen.\\n    See Wade Boggs.  I'd much rather see them develop Dave Silvestri\\n    or whoever.  Wade and Spike next to each other in the infield is\\n    going to raise the Yankee staff ERA 1/2 point.  And these guys\\n    are on the down sides of their careers.\\n\\n4.  Danny Tartabull.\\n    Yes - he's put up some tremendous numbers and it's nice to think\\n    about what he could do if he were ever healthy all year.  But he\\n    never is.  We should expect 120 games max out of him.  Meanwhile,\\n    Gerald Williams is playing at Columbus and Paul O'Neil is playing\\n    left field!  I believe O'Neil led NL outfielders in assists\\n    last year - and Tartabull is a poor defensive outfielder.\\n\\nWhat I'm basically getting at is the Yanks are moving in the right\\ndirection but are NOT ready to win a pennent this year.  They should\\n(at the GM level) be planning for a 1994 or 1995 world series.  This\\nmeans getting the younger players experience in the majors NOW so they \\nwill be ready in a year or two.  \\n\\nI'm afraid that all this stuff wreaks of George Steinbrenner.\\nCertainly, the Boggs deal was all George.  It looks like George is\\nplanning the right mix of veterans and young players to win a world\\nseries now.  The veterans are always available and can be added at any\\ntime (like Boston did this year).  Develop the young players first,\\nthen add the one or two veterans (or in the Yankees case, just keep\\nthem).  Let's all us Yankee fans hope that George doesn't dismantle\\nthe terrific job Stick and company have done building the Yankee\\norganization back into one of respect.  I'm really afraid that he will\\ntrade whoever it takes to patch holes today (relief pitching for\\nexample).  George must realize that the Yankees rebuilding process is\\nstill one or two years away.  Have patience George and we will all\\nenjoy the future.

Here are my impressions:\\n\\n1) Awesome power, especially over 3500rpm, when the turbo really comes on.\\n2) If you get on the power really hard in a tight corner, the front-wheel\\n   drive causes it to understeer heavily, and then viciously \"hook\" into\\n   the corner.  Not a desirable handling trait, but common in powerful\\n   front drive cars.  (The CSE is 200hp.  Mercedes is rear-drive, so it\\n   does not have this problem.)\\n3) Huge interior and cargo space.\\n4) The most \"rubbery\" shifter I have ever encountered.  I drove a 5spd.  It\\n   was absolutely numb.  You might be able to get used to it - I don\\'t know.\\n   I also didn\\'t like its location, which was too far down, and too far right.\\n   From the shifter\\'s position, I got the impression that Saab really designed\\n   the car for an automatic.\\n5) It was rather noisy:  Engine buzz, rattles, and creaks.  (Mercedes does\\n   not exhibit these characteristics.)\\n\\nYou should also check out the new BMW 525 \"touring\".  This is a wagon version\\nof the 525i.

       " '----- Begin Included Message -----\\n\\nThe following teaching is brought to you on behalf of Malcolm Smith\\nMinistries, a ministry dedicated to leading believers everywhere into a\\nknowledge of the love of God.  If you would like more info on the ministry,\\nand/or would like to comment on whether you found this teaching beneficial,\\ne-mail to Randy Hunt at rlhunt@hou.amoco.com.\\n\\n\\nLOVE IN THE MORNING  (Psalm 90:14)\\n\\nby Malcolm Smith\\n\\nMoses wrote this prayer at a weary time in the history of Israel. A generation\\nbefore the time of its writing, the people of Israel had stood at Kadesh,\\ngateway to Canaan, and made the fateful choice to go their own way rather\\nthan God\\'s way. They refused an adventure of faith in God which would\\nhave given them Canaan, the homeland of promise. God honored their\\ndecision, and said they would wander in the desert only a few miles from the\\nland of promise until they were all buried in the sand. The young decision-\\nmakers of that fateful day were between twenty and thirty years old, and\\ndestined to be dead within forty years... bleached bones in the desert by the\\ntime they were seventy-- eighty, at the most. The lives of these wanderers\\nhad been unending sadness. Moses described it as ending each year with a\\nsigh (v. 9). The fact that they knew, give or take a few months, when they\\nwere going to die, underscored the meaninglessness of their existence.\\nWhatever heights of success they reached, they would be a heap of bleached\\nbones within forty years.  The only ones to live outside of that depression of\\nhopeless disbelief were Joshua and Caleb, who had stood against the nation\\nat Kadesh and had God\\' s promise of one day entering the land. The\\nforty-year period was finally drawing to an end. The new generation, those\\nwho were children at Kadesh, were now grown and eager to take the\\ninheritance their parents had refused to enjoy. In the light of this, Moses\\nprays...it is time for a new day to begin and the days of misery to be over.\\nAll these years, as Moses had walked with these moaning and complaining\\npeople through the wilderness of their exile, he had carried a double burden.\\nHis was not only the sadness of living in less than what could have been; but\\nhe also knew why they had chosen as they had at Kadesh.  The problem was\\nthat they were ignorant of the character of their God. If asked. \"Who is your\\nGod?\" they would have described Him as the God who is Power. When\\nAaron had created their concept of God in an idol. he chose a calf. or young\\nbull--a symbol of power, of virility. In their minds, God was the young bull\\nwho had impaled Pharaoh on his horns and gored Egypt\\'s gods as He led\\nIsrael to Sinai.  But when man worships a God of power, His miracles grow\\nthin and even boring. After miracle food on the desert floor and water\\ngushing miraculously from the solid rock through the desert wasteland, the\\nGod of Almightiness becomes \"ho-hum --What\\' s next on the miracle menu?\"\\nAnd a God of power can be as unpredictable as a young bull calf. He might\\nbe all they need, but then...who knows? If He has all power, He has a right\\nto do whatever He wants, whenever He wants. The only person these people\\nhad known who had absolute power was Pharaoh, and men\\'s lives had hung\\non the whim of his moods, which could change with the wind. They believed\\nGod could work His wonders on their behalf, but they did not know HIM\\nand, so, could not trust Him. Israel had a God based on what He DID, His\\nacts; Moses knew the heart of God, the motivation behind the acts. From the\\nday of his encounter at the burning bush, Moses had been fascinated by God.\\nAt Sinai, he asked to be shown His glory...to know who He really was. He\\nhad seen what God had done; he wanted to know who God was. This\\nrequest was granted, and Moses was given a glimpse of God\\'s glorious\\nPerson. He had come to know the heart of God as compassion and\\nlovingkindness (Exodus 34:6,7). The word \"lovingkindness\" is not to be\\nunderstood as a human kind of love. It speaks of the kind of relationship\\narising out of the making of a covenant. It can only be understood as the\\nlove that says, \"I will never leave you nor forsake you.\" Lovingkindness is as\\ntenacious as a British bulldog; when the world walks out, this love digs in its\\nheels and refuses to leave.And it is not human romantic love, based on\\nfeelings and rooted in emotions. It is a love of covenant commitment and,\\ntherefore, operates quite apart from feelings. God\\'s love is not an emotion\\nthat wavers day by day; it is the total commitment of His Being to seek our\\nhighest and best, and to bring us to our fullest potential as humans. God\\ndoes not see something good and beautiful in us which arouses His feelings\\nof love toward us...we do not woo Him and cause Him to fall in love with\\nus! If that were the case, the first ugly, sinful thing we did would cause Him\\nto reject us.  He is Love, and He loves us because of who He is-- not\\nbecause of who we are. He does not love what we do, but He is committed\\nto us, pursuing us down every blind alley and bypath of foolishness. He will\\nnot let us go. His is a love that is not looking for what it can get out of us--\\nbut a committed love that searches for opportunities to give to us. It is\\nsaying to the recipient, \"For as long as we shall live, I am for you.\"  The God\\nwho has revealed Himself to man through Scripture and, finally, in Jesus--in\\nHis coming, and in His death and resurrection--is the God who is\\nlovingkindness. Thus He loves us and gives Himself to us...He will never\\nleave us nor forsake us.  Tragically, many believers have never seen Him as\\nlove; they see Him as power. No one will come to faith by just seeing\\nmiracles. Miracles point to who He is, and that is when faith springs in the\\nheart.  Israel did not see God as lovingkindness; they saw His acts of power.\\nMoses knew His ways, the kind of God He was, and the love that He had for\\nthese people. Because of their total lack of understanding of His love, they\\ncould not trust Him to be their strength in taking the land. Faith is born out\\nof knowing the love He has for us; it is the resting response to the One who\\ngives Himself to us. He is not the force, and to call Him the Almighty is to\\nmiss His heart. He is Love who is the Almighty and the Infinite Force.  If\\nman is to make force or raw power work for him, he must depend on\\nknowing the forrnula and have faith in it. But the power that issues from\\nlove demands faith in the Person of love Himself. The forty years of\\nmeaningless wandering was a monument to a people who had never come to\\nknow the God of love.  At this point, with the new generation and the\\npossibility of enjoying all that God promised, Moses prays verse 14. The\\nlanguage Moses uses is reminiscent of a baby having slept secure in its\\nmother\\'s love, now waking to look up into the delight of her eyes. It is\\nwaking to the consciousness of being loved... watched over, cared for,\\nprotected, fed, and cleaned, day and night, by the mother. Suppose we were\\nto ask, \"What has the baby done to deserve this?\" or, \"Have arrangements\\nbeen made for the child to repay the parents for this inconvenience?\" Our\\nquestions would be considered unnatural, even immoral. The child was\\nconceived in love, anticipated and prepared for with love\\'s excitement, a love\\nthat has been to the gates of death to bring it into being. The parents\\' love is\\nunconditional, spontaneous...it has nothing to do with the looks of the child\\nor its performance. So God is love. He loves us unconditionally,\\nspontaneously. We were conceived in His imagination and fashioned after\\nHis image, to be brought to where we are at this moment by the blood of the\\nLord Jesus. It is slanderous, and immoral, to even ask what we must do to\\nearn and deserve that love. The child discovers its personhood and identity\\nthrough the eyes and touch, through the cuddles, of its parents\\' love. It is a\\nscientific fact that a baby who is not touched and held will probably die or, if\\nit survives, will have severe emotional problems. And a person who has been\\nheld and loved will still never know the true meaning of life without the\\nembrace and knowledge of love from God. Moses prays that the new\\ngeneration will learn to wake every morning, resting with total confidence in\\nthe love of God. and will receive all His promises and blessings with joy and\\ngladness. Significantly, Moses prays that they will be SATISFIED with His\\nlove. \"Satisfied.\" in the Hebrew language. is a rich picture word describing\\nbeing filled with an abundance of gourmet food. It is also used to describe\\nthe earth after the rain has soaked it and all the vegetation has received\\nenough water. Moses prays that they will awaken every morning to be\\ndrenched in the life-giving love of God. That sense of satisfaction is the\\nlifelong quest of every man and woman. When we are satisfied in our\\ndeepest selves, many of our emotional--and even our physical--problems\\ndisappear. Man seeks that sense of satisfaction which comes from feeling\\nthat he is fulfilled as a human being...his hours have meaning, which make\\nsense out of the ordinary and mundane. Apart from God, man seeks this\\nsatisfaction through intellectual pursuit, through the exciting of the\\nemotions, and through the feeding of his body...he will even seek it in\\nreligious exercise. But man will always be dissatisfied until he is responding\\nto the love of the living God. Only in knowing God\\'s love will the rest of life\\nmake sense. As the forty years drew to a close and the land of promise again\\nbecame the inheritance to be taken, Moses prayed this psalm. I find it\\nfascinating that he  should pray and ask God for a daily revelation of His\\nlove. Considering the awe with which the people held Moses. one would\\nthink he could have lectured them on the subject of lovingkindness and, by\\nthe knowledge they gained, they would live in it. But Moses knew\\nbetter. God is the only one who can make known to us His love. We won\\'t\\nfind it in a religious lecture or a formula which we can learn and use to\\nmanipulate Him. Nor is it in a beautiful poem to titillate our emotions and\\ngive us God feelings. It is God, himself, the Lover, who must open our eyes\\nand satisfy us with His love. This prayer is man, in helplessness, asking God\\nto make the love He is real in our hearts. Moses\\' prayer was partially\\nanswered in the next generation and seen in the exploits of faith which\\nworked by love in The Book of Judges. But it would not be answered in its\\nfullest dimensions until the coming of the Holy Spirit, who pours out the\\nlove of God in our hearts (Romans 5:5). In the history of the early Church,\\nwe read of the Holy Spirit \"falling upon\" the believers. This is an ancient\\nexpression that, in modern English, means to give a bear hug. It is used in\\nLuke 15 to describe the father running to the prodigal and \"falling on his\\nneck and kissing him.\" The Holy Spirit is God hugging you in your deepest\\nself and smothering you with divine kisses at the deepest level of your\\nbeing. This is not a one-time experience to be filed in our spiritual resumes.\\nMoses prayed that morning by morning we would awaken to the realization\\nthat we are loved. The world, and much of our religious training, has taught\\nus to perform in order to be accepted. We have spent far too long living in a\\nstate of doing in order to find satisfaction for ourselves...to find acceptance\\nand love from others, and from God. We now come humbled to receive love\\nwe cannot earn...to be still and let Him tell us we are loved: to let the Holy\\nSpirit descend into us, pouring out the love of God. We come in stillness to\\nthink on and repeat His words of love to our minds. which have been jaded\\nwith the doctrine of \"perform to be accepted.\" We begin to realize that He\\nloves us as we are, and gives meaning and purpose to all of life. I challenge\\neveryone reading this to begin each day, from the moment you open your\\neyes, by celebrating the God of love and praying this prayer. You may not\\nfeel anything, but SOMETHING ALWAYS HAPPENS. I was X-rayed the\\nother day. I did not see or feel anything, but I noted that the technicians kept\\nbehind protective walls. They know you cannot be exposed to those rays\\nwithout being affected. So it is as we consciously begin our day knowing\\nthat we are loved. Such experiential knowledge will produce, according to\\nMoses, \"joy and gladness all our days.\" Joy is the result of a life that is\\nfunctioning as God intended us to function when He made us. You might say\\nthat joy is the hum of an engine that is at peak performance. Man\\' s highest\\nperformance is to rest in the love God has for him... the hum will be joy, and\\nthe result will be endless creativity arising from the sense of meaning he now\\nhas in life. Stop wandering in the wilderness. Be satisfied with His love and,\\nin joy, day by day, receive all His promised blessings.\\n',\n",

       " '\\nIndeed, the immediate context [NASB] is:\\n\\n  26 Otherwise, He would have needed to suffer often\\n  since the foundation of the world; but now once at\\n  the consummation He has been manifested to put away \\n  sin by the sacrifice of Himself.\\n\\n  27 And inasmuch as it is appointed for men to die\\n  once, and after this comes judgement;\\n\\n  28 so Christ also, having been offered once to bear\\n  the sins of many, shall appear a second time, not to\\n  bear sin, tro those who eagerly await him.\\n\\n\\nThe first point is that this verse is part of an even larger\\ncontext, the subject of which is not the destiny of the\\nindividual human soul but rather the singular nature of Christ\\'s\\nsacrifice, \"once\", and the fulfillment of the law for all of fallen \\nmankind.  Rudolf Frieling elaborates this in detail in his \\n\"Christianity and Reincarnation\".  The thrust of the passage\\nin its context is to liken the one time incarnation and \\nsacrifice of Christ for all mankind to the individual \\nexperience of the human being after death.  The \"once\" \\nis repeated and emphasized, and it highlights the singularity \\nof Christ\\'s deed.  One thing for certain it does is to \\nrefute the claims of some that Christ incarnates more than \\nonce.  But the comparison to the human experience - die \\nonce, then judgement (note: not \"the judgement\", but just \\n\"judgement\".  The word for judgement is \"krisis\".\\n\\nHebrews 9:27 is the one passage most often quoted in defense\\nof the doctrine that the Bible denies reincarnation.  At this\\npoint, I would just emphasize again that the  passages \\nthat (arguably) speak against it are few, and that invariably\\nthey are talking about something eles, and the apparent denial\\nof reincarnation is either inferred, or, as in the case of\\nHebrews, taken literally and deposited into an implied context,\\nnamely a doctrine of the destiny of the human being after\\ndeath.\\n\\nWhat should be considered seriously is that the Bible is essentially\\nsilent about the fate of the individual human being between death\\nand the Last Day.  If you take the few passages that could possibly\\nbe interpreted to mean a single earth life, they are arguable.  And\\nthere are other passages that point, arguably, in the other direc-\\ntion. such as Matthew 11:14 and John 9:2.\\n\\nWe can continue to debate the individual scraps of scripture that\\nmight have a bearinig on this, and indeed we should discuss them.\\nBut what I wanted to introduce into the discussion was an approach\\nto the idea of repeated earth lives that, unlike Hindu, Buddhist\\nand \"new age\" teachings, takes full cognizance of the divinity, singular\\nincarnation, death, burial, resurrection, and second coming of Christ\\nas the savior of mankind; the accountability of each individual for\\nhis deeds and the reality of the Fall and of sin and its consequences;\\nthe redemption of man from sin through Christ; the resurrection of\\nthe body, and the Last Judgement.\\n\\nTaken in this larger sense, many serious questions take on an entirely\\ndifferent perspective.  E.g. the destiny of those who died in their\\nsins before Christ came. the relationship of faith and grace to \\nworks, the meaning of \"deathbed conversion\", the meaning of the\\nsacraments, and many other things.  Not that I propose to answer all\\nthose questions by a simple doctrine of convenience, but only that\\nthe discussion takes on a different dimension, and in my opinion\\none that is truly worthy of both man, the earth, and their Creator and \\nRedeemer. There are many deep questions that continue to be deep, such \\nas the meaning of the second death, and how the whole of Christian\\ndoctrine would apply to this larger perspective of human existence.\\n\\nThere are those who deeply believe that the things of which the Bible \\ndoes not speak are not things we should be concerned with.  But Christ\\nalso indicated that there were other things that we would come to know\\nin the future, including things that his disciples (and therefore others) \\ncould not bear yet.  This idea that the human capacity for growth in\\nknowledge, not only of the individual in one lifetime, but of the whole\\nof humanity, also takes on great meaning when we realize that our growth\\nin the spirit is a long term process.  The Bible was not meant to codify\\nall spiritual knowledge in one place forever, but to proclaim the gospel\\nof the incarnation and redeeming deed of Christ - taking the gospel in the\\ngreater context, from Genesis to Revelation.  Now, salvation (healing) becomes, \\nnot the end of man\\'s sojourn but its beginning.  And the Last Judgement and\\nthe New Heaven and Earth that follow it become its fulfullment.',\n",

       " '(This is a continuation of an earlier post)\\n\\n\\n(I am sorry you found this offensive.  It was not my intent to offend.  I was \\nleading up to another point, which I discuss in more detail below.)\\n\\n\\nI can see you have a revulsion for bestiality that far exceeds my distaste for \\nhomosexuality.  Certainly if I spoke about homosexuality the way you speak of \\nbestiality, nobody would have any trouble labelling me a homophobe.  Let me ask \\nthis gently:  why are you so judgemental of other people\\'s sexual preferences?  \\nWhat happened to \"No doubt I am free to do anything\"?  I think you have a \\nserious double standard here.  When you describe a comparison between \\nhomosexuality and bestiality as \"slimey\" and \"sleazy\", you are making an \\nimplicit judgement that bestiality is perverted, sinful, disgusting, \\nunnatural--in short, all the things that society once thought about \\nhomosexuality.  Not all people share your view.  You claim not to know any \\nsincere zoophiles, but this does not mean that they do not exist.  They even \\nhave their own newsgroup:  alt.sex.bestiality.  Are you going to accuse them \\nall of being mere \"jokers\"?\\n\\nI notice you deleted the main point of my comment:  the fact that the only \\nBiblical condemnations of bestiality occur in connection with the Levitical \\nprohibitions against homosexuality.  While there are some New Testament \\npassages that can arguably be taken as condemning homosexuality, there are none \\nthat condemn bestiality.  One of your main points seems to be that Christian \\nhomosexuality is acceptable due to the lack of any \"clear\" New Testament \\nstatements against it; if this is a valid argument, then should not Christian \\nzoophilia be made that much more acceptable by the fact that the New Testament \\nmakes no reference, clear or unclear, to the subject at all?\\n\\nI am quite serious here.  If I am going to accept homosexuality as Biblically \\nacceptable on the basis of your arguments, then I am going to be fair and apply \\nthe same standards to everyone else\\'s declared sexual preferences as well.  If \\nthe arguments you make for homosexuality can be applied to other sexual \\npreferences as well, I\\'m going to apply them and see what comes up.  I\\'m not \\ntrying to \"torpedo a serious issue\" by using what you label \"a ridiculous \\njoke\".  I posted a question about how we should interpret Biblical guidelines \\nfor Christian sexuality, and I don\\'t think such a question is \"irrelevant\" in a \\ngroup called \"soc.religion.christian\".  The Bible discusses homosexuality and \\nbestiality together in the same context, and therefore I feel I have a good \\nprecedent for doing the same.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t know whether it makes any difference, but for the record, this is not a \\nside issue for me.  I believe loving one another includes not encouraging \\npeople to defile themselves, therefore it is of high importance to determine \\nwhether God regards certain sexual acts as defiling.  I can read in the New \\nTestament that \"God has joined together\" heterosexual couples, and that the \\nmarriage bed is undefiled.  I can read in the Old Testament that homosexual \\nintercourse and bestiality defile a person whether or not that person is under \\nthe Law.  If gay Christians can validly put aside the Old Testament standards \\nof defilement, then I want to know so that I can fairly apply it to all the \\nsexual practices that defiled a person in the old days.  I don\\'t think it\\'s \\nright to take just bits and pieces of the Law and try and apply them to \\nChristians today, e.g. bestiality still defiles you but homosexuality doesn\\'t.  \\nThat was pretty much what you said earlier, right?  You used different \\nexamples, but I think you said essentially the same thing about it being wrong \\nto apply only certain parts of the Law to Christians. \\n\\n\\nIt was not my intent to stir up such an emotional reaction.  I personally don\\'t \\nget all that upset discussing alternatives to the monogamous heterosexual \\norientation; I\\'m afraid I naively assumed that others would have a similar \\nattitude.  Please note that I have never intended to equate homosexuality with \\nchild abuse.  I have merely noted that, for all the lack of \"clear\" NT \\ncondemnation of homosexuality, there is an even greater lack of NT condemnation \\n(or even mention) of bestiality, a practice which a number of people (e.g. on \\nalt.sex.bestiality) consider to be their true sexual orientation.\\n\\n\\nThis is an excellent question, and I pray that you will not treat it as a mere \\nrhetorical question, but will genuinely seek to discover and understand the \\nanswer.  I recommend you begin with a little introspection into why you \\nyourself have much the same attitude towards zoophilia.  Why do you find \\nbestiality so repugnant that you regard it as slanderous to even mention in \\nconnection with other alternative sexual orientations?  Why do you not apply \\nall the same verses about love and tolerance to zoophiles the way you apply \\nthem to homosexuals?\\n\\nIs it because you automatically experience a subjective feeling of revulsion at \\nthe thought?  A lot of people have the same experience at the thought of \\nhomosexual intercourse.  Is it because you regard the practice as socially \\nunacceptable?  A lot of people regard homosexuality as socially unacceptable.  \\nDo you feel that it violates the traditional Judeo-Christian standard of sexual \\nmorality?  Many people feel that homosexuality does.  Do you feel the Bible \\ncondemns it?  Many people think the Bible says more to condemn homosexuality \\nthan it does to condemn bestiality.  Why then do you think comparing bestiality \\nwith homosexuality is insulting to homosexuality?  If you can honestly answer \\nthis question, you will have come a long way towards understanding why many \\npeople feel the same way about homosexuality as you feel about bestiality.\\n\\nAlso please note that I am not in any sense condemning *people*.  I am merely \\npointing out that when I read the Bible I see certain sexual *practices* that \\nthe Bible appears to condemn, e.g. sex outside of marriage.  When I say I think \\nadultery and pre-marital sex are sinful, do you take that as me failing to love \\nmy neighbor?  When you treat bestiality as something disgusting and \\nunmentionable, are you disobeying \"repeated orders not to judge or condemn \\nothers\"?  When you say other Christians are guilty of sinning by condemning you \\nand judging you, are you by that accusation making yourself guilty of the same \\noffense?  Or are you and I both simply taking note about *practices* the Bible \\nbrands as sinful, and leaving the judgement of the *people* up to God?\\n\\n\\nI\\'m not sure what you mean by the above two paragraphs.  If you mean that Jesus \\nis the Truth, and that He accepts sinners, and does not reject them, then I \\nagree.  If we were not sinners, then we would not *need* a Savior.  Our \\nsalvation in Christ, however, does not mean that sin is now irrelevant for us, \\nand we can now do whatever we want.  Nor does Christ\\'s grace mean that those \\nwho refer to sin as \"sin\" are being judgemental or intolerant.  I am speaking \\nin general terms here, not specifically about homosexuality.  If the Bible \\ncalls something \"sin\", then it is not unreasonable for Christians to call it \\nsin too.\\n\\nAs applied to Christian homosexuality, I think the only definitive authority on \\nChristian sexuality is the Bible.  If you make a list of everything the Bible \\nsays on the subject of homosexual intercourse, I think you will find that every \\nverse on the list is negative and condemning at worst, and \"unclear\" at best.  \\nThe most pro-gay statement you could make about the list is that there is some \\ndispute about the New Testament verses which many people interpret as \\ncondemning homosexual intercourse.  That is, from a gay perspective, the most \\npositive thing you can say about the Bible\\'s treatment of homosexuality is that \\nsome verses fail to clearly condemn it.  That\\'s it.  Jesus declared all foods \\nclean, the council at Jerusalem declared that Gentiles were not required to \\nkeep the ritual Law, but nobody ever reclassified homosexual intercourse from \\nbeing an abomination deserving of death to being an accepted Christian \\npractice.  You have verses describing homosexual intercourse as an abomination \\nthat defiles both Jews under the Law and Gentiles not under the Law, and you \\nhave some verses which are at best \"not clear\" but which some people believe \\n*are* clear in their condemnation of homosexual behavior, and that\\'s the sum \\ntotal of what the Bible says about same-sex intercourse.\\n\\nI can appreciate (from personal experience) your desire to have everything \\nsimple, cut-and-dried, black-and-white, what-I-want- is-ok, and \\nthose-who-oppose-me-are-wicked.  However, I do not think the Bible makes your \\ncase as definitively as you would like it to.  In fact, I don\\'t believe it says \\nanything positive about your case at all.  Yes, I know the verses about loving \\none another, and not judging one another, but that\\'s not really the issue, is \\nit?  You know and admit that there are still things that are sinful for \\nChristians to do, since you say it is wrong for Christians to condemn you.  \\nTherefore, the issue is whether the Bible says homosexual intercourse is a sin.  \\nEven if you do challenge the clarity of the New Testament verses, you are still \\nleft with the fact that the only thing the Bible does say clearly about \\nhomosexual intercourse is that it is an abomination that defiles both those who \\nare under the law and those who are not.\\n\\n- Mark\\n',\n",

       " 'Note:  I\\'m not posting this as part of an argument with Roger Meynard,\\nbut as an independent sort of thread.  I do actually quote some things\\nthat Roger Meynard wrote, but it might be better to think of this as\\n\"sampling\" his post (in the hip-hop sense) because it fits in with what\\nI want to say.\\n\\n\\nThere\\'s an interesting parallel between this way of viewing a baseball\\nteam and some people\\'s conception of a biological organism.  In the\\nbiology context, we would very likely read \"fitness\" for \"the score of\\nthe game\" and \"organisms\" for \"teams\".  How we interpret \"players\" is\\ntrickier, but either \"organs\", or \"genes\" might seem reasonable\\nchoices depending on what point we were trying to make.  A \"genes\"\\ninterpretation actually might be really interesting in this case, \\nbut that would be a different and probably longer post.\\n\\nIf, however, we take the \"organ\" view, then our knowledge of biology\\nshould make us pause before we start saying things like \"species X is\\nmore fit than species Y because of a better organ Z\".  Given what we\\nknow about the interdependence of organs, we would often be suspicious\\nof such claims.  (But note that this type of argument is quite often\\nmade when you map \"species X\" onto \\'humans\\', and \"organ Z\" onto\\n\\'brain\\').  On the other hand, some statements of this kind do seem\\nmore reasonable than others, as far as we can test them (e.g. \\'brain\\'\\nabove might be more reasonable than \\'pancreas\\' assuming no gross\\npathology, particularly if species Y is a primate).\\n\\nEven when you make such statements, you should be concerned with the\\nfunctioning of the whole organism, and the possibility that one organ\\nmight be more crucial for one species and a second organ in another.\\n(Not to mention the possibility that no organ is particularly crucial\\nin some third species.)  However, if we are non-vitalists with any\\nkind of reductionsit streak, we will want to say that an organism is\\nnot some completely magical unanalyzable \"whole\" but an intriguing\\nprocess made up of various subprocesses that interact in ways that are\\npotentially observable.  Some of these processes might be localized to\\nparticular organs, while others may be distributed across multiple\\norgans.  In a way, this is just like a baseball team, except that I\\nthink it is pretty clear that the processes and interactions involved\\nin baseball are *much* simpler and less numerous than in most organisms.\\n\\n\\nOne thing that is quite difficult about baseball is that perfectly\\ncontrolled experiments are sometimes very tough to do.  But, of\\ncourse, this has never stopped researchers from doing the best they\\ncan, and sometimes deriving very powerful conclusions even in the\\nabsence of certainty.  Most of this goes far beyond sheer speculation,\\nbut even sheer speculation can motivate further interesting research.\\n\\n\\nIn this cases, we\\'re seeing the word \"statistics\" means \"summary of\\nobserved events\", where the events themselves can be viewed as the\\noutput of some process, and possibly inputs for other processes.\\nThus, if we have any valid notion of how the processes are put together\\ninto the functioning organism, data in the form of statistics might\\ngive us a basis to test particular hypotheses.\\n\\n\\nThis statement brings us back to the concept of fitness again.\\nFitness is defined in terms of both an organism and its environment;\\nyou might be fit in one situation and not another.  Moving to\\nbaseball, it is clear that each team spends the entire season in an\\nenvironment including all the other teams in the league.  In at least\\na nominal sense, the division winners are the fittest teams in the\\nleague, in that they (on average) had better fitness scores than any\\nof their competing opponennts.  But in a real sense, there is a fairly\\nlarge random component in the performance of each team that is\\ndifficult if not impossible to account for in terms of factors\\nintrinsic to (or interesting for) baseball.  The same is true in\\nbiology.  But here is also no direct biological equivalent of the\\nWorld Series in basebal.  In the world series, the random component\\nmay be greatly magnified by the small number of games that are played,\\nand both teams suddenly experience huge changes from the environement\\nwhere they were originally successful.  It might be fun to watch, but\\nit\\'s unclear what it all really means.\\n\\n***\\n\\nNow just one more un-related point:\\n\\n\\nOn the other hand, you have seen some of us who can predict the\\noutcome of the divisional races better than a random assignment of\\nteams to finishes, and maybe some of us (e.g. me) who can do this\\nbetter than the other participants in this forum on a regular basis.\\nBut this is probably only due to the fact that a 162-game schedule\\ngives you a little hope that bad hops aren\\'t the only difference\\nbetween the winners and the losers.\\n\\nMoreover, you\\'ve had the opportunity to see some analysis of the World\\nSeries situation that makes the strong claim that *nobody* can predict\\nthe WS winner with reliably greater accuracy than a coin biased only\\nto reflect the well-known home vs. road effect on winning percentage.\\n\\n\\nSince stats are summaries of events, it\\'s true that if you know the\\nevents you can derive the stats.  But if somebody is trying to\\nunderstand the process behind the stats, then the stats produce new\\nknowledge, and some of this might even be reliable, repeatable, and\\nuseful.

The clutch had no effect.\\n   2- The front tires would not budge, even when the clutch is\\n      fully depressed.\\n   3- If the clutch is released the engine would die.\\n   4- Assuming that some gear was engaged while the shifter was\\n      stuck, I could not make the car move.  It acted as if\\n      it were in Neutral(except for dying when clutch is released.)\\n   5- I finally was able to release the shifter by having \\n      someone rock the car back and forth (less than an inch),\\n      while I depressed the clutch and jiggled the shifter.\\n   6- The shifter acted normally after that.\\n\\nWhen this happened, I took it to the dealer, they checked the \\nclutch, it was o.k. They checked the transmission, it was o.k.\\n\\nI had the exact problem a couple of months ago, and again last\\nweek.  The dealer says there is nothing they can do because \\nMitsubishi (the 800 #) says they have never heard of the\\nproblem, and the dealer could not reproduce the problem while\\nthey had the car.  \\nIn all three occurances, the car was parked head first in a garage,\\nand since the front wheels were stuck, the car could not be towed\\nto the dealer before releasing the shifter (hence temporarily\\nsolving the problem).  And the dealer, and Mitsubishi, refused to\\nsend someone to check the car while it was stuck. \\nI KNOW there is smething wrong with the transmission (shifting \\nfrom 2nd to 3rd), and getting stuck at random, but I can\\'t get \\nthe dealer to fix it.

His translations of them were quick-and-dirty, also (he\\nreports having done one of them in one day, and another overnight, just\\ndictating his translation to an amanuensis.\\n\\nThat is to say, it is the Vulgate, and all of its massive importance in\\nWestern Christianity, along with the veneration of Jerome, which took the\\nfirst steps in \"reducing\" these books from the status they had (and have)\\namong the Greeks.\\n\\nFurthermore, it is inaccurate to say that the Reformers \"threw out\" these\\nbooks.  Basically, they just placed them in a secondary status (as Jerome\\nhad already done), but with the additional warning that doctrine should\\nnot be based on citations from these ALONE.\\n\\nI think that the emphasis on the Hebrew originals is sound, though it\\nseems somewhat arbitrary to disallow on the face of it a translation as\\npart of a collection whose principles of selection (in Hebrew or Greek)\\nare confused or unknown and likely fraught with accident.  It also seems\\nto play into a tendentious notion of the original languages being somehow\\n\"more inspired\" -- as if magical, and conveying a message untranslatable\\n-- than a translation, as if we could not hear God\\'s word to the Jews in\\nGreek (or German, or English, ...).

The various predictions (I\\'m talking about those that\\nappear to be sincere and sober) are hard to accept, yet hard to ignore com-\\npletely.  One has the feeling \"something is about to start to get ready to \\nbegin to commence to happen\".  We are living, as the Chinese saying goes,\\nin interesting times.\\n\\nAs for how to discriminate, the Bible doesn\\'t help much.  There is an Old\\nTestament passage (I forget where it is) that says you will know whether\\na prophet is true by whether or not his prophecy comes to pass.  That\\nhelps eliminate the failures after the fact, but in the case of an earth-\\nquake it is small comfort.  It seems to me that all prophecies that give\\nspecific times and places and events should be suspect, not in that they\\nare necessarily false, but in the sense stated above, that all such visions\\nare subject to mistranslation from the plane of prophetic vision to the\\nplane of earthly time and space.\\n\\nFor what it is worth, Rudolf Steiner once was asked whether a modern initiate \\ncould see into the future and predict coming events.  His answer was that \\nit would be possible but then he would have to withdraw from active parti-\\ncipation in them, including proclaiming what he saw.  If this is in fact\\na spiritual law, then the answer to your question about how to discriminate\\nis that the one who makes such prophecies is probably violating that law,\\nknowingly or unknowingly, and as such his message should be considered\\na priori to be dubious.  I.e. I would expect that those capable of making\\ntrue predictions and giving accurate expression to them would not do so in \\nthe way that the prophet of the Oregon earthquake did.  However, I can\\nsympathize with the person who published the prophecy. Given the same\\noverwhelming experience that he apparently had,  I too might feel impelled, \\nand even commissioned by God to tell my fellow human beings about what \\nI had seen.\\n\\nGerry Palo (73237.2006@compuserve.com)\\n',\n",

       " '\\n\\n\\nThis is something I\\'ve always found a little curious. I\\'ve never quite understood\\nthe trinity thing. On the one hand, Jesus is supposed to be God incarnate. But,\\nat the same time, he is God\\'s son \"For God so loved the world that he gave his\\nonly begotten son\". First question is, if Jesus was God in human form, how could\\nhe really be God\\'s son? If the Holy Ghost \"planted the seed\" in Mary, so to speak,\\nthen it seems that Jesus\\' relationship to God would be the equivalent to the\\nhuman father/son relationship. While a son might inherit alot of the father\\'s \\nqualities, he is not the father. They are still two separite entities. To try\\nand say that a son is the same person as the father is obviously wrong. In that\\ncase, Jesus and God aren\\'t the same. On the other hand, if their relationship\\nisn\\'t the same as the human father/son relationship, but Jesus is actually God\\nincarnate, then he\\'s not really God\\'s son and he never was. He\\'s just God\\nmanifesting himself as Jesus. At least, this is how I\\'m seeing it. Can someone\\nwho is more knowledgeable about the trinity enlighten us? \\n\\nGetting back to the original question, what is the great price that Jesus paid\\nto redeem our sins? Was it dying on the cross? Since Jesus knew that he would\\nrise again in 3 days and then ascend back to heaven, I have a hard time seeing\\nhow this is considered paying such a great price for humanity. His earthly body\\nmay have been killed, but then, so what? He suffered a few hours of physical\\npain, but then, there has been many a human who has suffered a great deal more.\\nThe fact that Jesus was God\\'s only begotten son doesn\\'t seem to me to have much\\nmeaning since God can beget as many sons as he wants to. Jesus being the only\\none was simply a matter of choice. I suspect that these questions will be very\\noffensive to many Christians on this net. To those people, please accept my\\nsincere apologies. It is not my intention to offend or to trivialize Christ.\\nBut, I do believe these are legitimate questions and I am genuinely curious.\\n \\n[Note that the Trinity and Incarnation have to be looked at together.\\nFirst, your reading of the Virgin Birth is an uncommon one.  (In this\\ngroup, it\\'s dangerous to say that no one believes something.)  You\\nseem to be suggesting the Jesus is God\\'s son in a physical sense,\\nwith the Holy Spirit as Father and Mary as Mother.  I consider that\\nterrible heresy, though some people react less violently.  The Virgin\\nBirth says that Jesus\\' birth is God\\'s responsibility.  But it doesn\\'t\\nimply that God\\'s sperm was involved.  Indeed one (though by no means\\nthe only) speculation is that God used Joseph\\'s genetic material.\\n\\nSecond, Jesus is in some sense doubly indirect from the Father.  In a\\nTrinitarian context, the term Son refers to the eternal Logos, who is\\na part of God.  The Son didn\\'t come into existence with Jesus\\' birth.\\nJesus is the incarnation of the Son.  So his sonness isn\\'t\\nspecifically a result of being incarnated.  Rather, it\\'s the Son\\nwho was incarnated.',\n",

A Jewish poster to other newsgroups on Jewish esotericism and other\\ntopics has outlined the esoteric, cabbalistic Jewish teaching of of\\nreincarnation and Karma, a teaching that is little known among Jews\\ntoday, but which is apparently widespread enough in Israel that Hannah\\nHurnard (\"Hinds Feet on High Places\") was told about it by a Rabbi\\nshe was trying to convert back in the 1940s as a missionary in Palestine.\\nThus there may well have been a small number of Jews who knew about this,\\nwhereas the large number of people did not.

It\\'s compatible with the\\n    X11 window system from MIT as well as (currently) Sun\\'s NeWS and SunView,\\n    so you can intermix programs written for any of those systems.\\n    It comes from Sun and also with System V Release 4 from certain vendors.\\n    OpenWindows is sometimes also called openwin or xnews, after the\\n    program used to start it and the main executable itself, respectively.\\n    It should not be called `Windows\\' or \\'OPEN LOOK\\' or `OpenLook\\', as\\n    these terms are either wrong or apply to something else.\\n    A commerical OpenWindows source licence costs about $5,000 for the server,\\n    plus about $25,000 for DeskSet, and another $40,000 for ToolTalk.\\n    The current versions of OpenWindows for various platforms are:\\n\\tSunOS 4.1.1 on Sun 3: 2.0\\n\\tSolaris 1.x (SunOS 4.1.x) on SPARC: 3.0\\n\\tSolaris 2.0 (SunOS 5) on SPARC: 3.0.1\\n\\n    See Also:\\n\\tMixing X11 and OpenWindows\\n\\tWhere can I get it?\\n\\n@ What are OLIT, XView and TNT?\\n    These are all toolkits for programmers to use in developing programs\\n    that conform to the OPEN LOOK specifications.  See the Bibliography\\n    for documentation on the individual toolkits.  Here\\'s a brief summary:\\n\\n    OLIT was AT&T\\'s OPEN LOOK Intrinsics Toolkit for the X Window system;\\n    it used a widget set, and was probably the easiest for people who were\\n    already X11/Xt programmers to learn.  You could buy the source from AT&T,\\n    although you didn\\'t get the same version tht Sun ship.  Sun includes the\\n    OLIT library in OpenWindows (q.v.); it is also often included in\\n    System V Release 4.  It was written in C.  The release of OLIT in\\n    OpenWindows 3.0 was OLIT 3.0.  OLIT support passed to USL (then a\\n    division of AT&T, now owned by Novell), who replaced it with MoOLIT (q.v.).\\n    Note that because of the nature of Xt subclassing, you will probably\\n    want or need OLIT source in order to develop a large application or\\n    anything else that uses subclasses.\\n    [see the proceedings of the 1991 X Technical Conference]\\n\\n    XView is Sun\\'s toolkit for X11, written in C.  XView is similar in\\n    programmer interface to SunView.  There\\'s even a shell script to help\\n    migrate source code from SunView to XView.\\t XView is often said to be\\n    the easiest toolkit to learn if you are not familiar with X Windows.\\n    The XView toolkit is included in OpenWindows, and full source is\\n    available by anonymous ftp from export.lcs.mit.edu (and elsewhere).\\n    The current version of XView from Sun is 3.0.\\n    Despite rumours to the contrary -- some even from within Sun -- the\\n    XView toolkit is *NOT* about to be dropped by Sun.  XView *will* be\\n    included in the next release of OpenWindows, unlike NeWS.\\n    On the other hand, the XView toolkit is not likely to receive as much\\n    attention from Sun in the future as OLIT.\\n\\n    The NeWS Toolkit (TNT) was an object-oriented programming system based\\n    on the PostScript language and NeWS.  TNT implements many of the\\n    OPEN LOOK interface components required to build the user interface of\\n    an application.  It\\'s currently included in OpenWindows.\\n\\n    The current version of TNT from Sun is 3.1; Release 3 contains some\\n    incompatibilities with `tNt\\' 1.0 and TNT 2.0, but Sun are committed to\\n    supporting the API, at least until they stop NeWS support some time\\n    later this year and replace it with Display PostScript.  Wail.\\n    You might ask what `is committed to\\' means in this context; the\\n    answer seems to be that it means absolutely nothing.\\n    Sun currently asserts that it is committed to OLIT, however.\\n\\n    The C++ User Interface Toolkit (UIT) consists of an object-oriented C++\\n    class library layered on top of XView and a tool to generate code from\\n    DevGuide 3 GIL files.  The UIT also includes features that simplify\\n    event management and the use of PostScript and color.  It is said to be\\n    compatible with OpenWindows V2 and V3, and presumably V3.0.1, since the\\n    release mentions that it works on Solaris 2.\\n    UIT is not an official Sun-supported product but an ongoing project of\\n    various people within Sun.  It can be found on export.lcs.mit.edu in\\n    the MIT contrib directory as UITV2.tar.Z (use binary mode!).\\n\\n@ Where does Motif fit in?\\n    It doesn\\'t :-).  Motif is an alternative Graphical User Interface that\\n    is being developed by OSF.\\tIt has a `look and feel\\' reminiscent of\\n    Microsoft Windows and the OS/2 Presentation Manager.  There are no non-\\n    commercial Motif toolkits available, although the Motif source is sold\\n    reasonably cheaply by OSF.\\tAlthough Motif is currently available on\\n    more platforms than OpenWindows, the OPEN LOOK GUI is almost certainly\\n    used on many more machines, simply because Sun (and SysVR4) have such a\\n    large installed base.\\n    Sun\\'s CD/WARE Volume 2 contains a roadmap for improving Motif\\n    applications by converting them to OLIT [:-)]; there are also notes in\\n    the `Periodic Table\\' OLIT demo, $OPENWINHOME/demo/olittable.\\n\\n@ What is MoOLIT?\\n    MoOLIT is a version of OLIT from AT&T/USL that lets users choose between\\n    a Motif and an OPEN LOOK UI feel at run-time.  It will be part of System V\\n    Release 4.2.\\n    Contact: Joanne Newbauer, jo@usl.com, (908) 522-6677\\n\\n@ What about that Display PostScript thing?\\n    Sun and Adobe have agreed that Sun will include the DPS extension to X\\n    in the next release of OpenWindows.  DPS is essentially a badly designed\\n    hack on top of a slow Level 2 PostScript interpreter intended to give a\\n    very small subset of the functionality of NeWS whilst simultaneously\\n    being harder to use, as I understand it.  The only real advantage it\\n    has over NeWS is that the manual is much smaller, being generally less\\n    complete; DPS is also available on more kinds of machine.\\n    Performance on our RS/6000 is not suitable for interactive work;\\n    what it will be like on the SPARCStation remains to be seen.\\n    Note that whereas X/NeWS fonts are shared by both subsystems, the DPS\\n    extension to X does _not_ make Type 1 PostScript fonts available to\\n    ordinary X11 programs.  It is not like ATM on a PC in this regard.\\n    (there is at least one third-party version which does make fonts\\n    available, however)\\n\\nSubject: Window Managers -- olwm, olvwm\\n\\n@ What are olwm and olvwm?\\n    They are window managers.  A window manager is the part of the X Window\\n    system (e.g. X11) that is responsible for deciding how to lay out windows\\n    on the screen, and for managing the user\\'s interaction with the windows.\\n\\n    Olwm is the standard OPEN LOOK window manager.\\n    It\\'s included with all of the OpenWindows (q.v.) implementations, and\\n    you can also get the source by ftp, since Sun donated it.\\n\\n    Olvwm is a version of olwm that manages a `virtual desktop\\' (hence the\\n    `v\\' in its name).  It shows a little map on the screen, with the\\n    currently displayed area represented by a little rectangle.\\t You can\\n    move around by dragging the rectangle or with the arrow keys.  This\\n    lets you run several clients (applications) and move the display around\\n    from one to the other.  Olvwm was derived from the OpenWindows 3.0 olwm\\n    by Scott Oaks; you need to have XView 3.0 to compile it.\\n    Get olvwm from an ftp site such as export.lcs.mit.edu (in the contrib\\n    directory; there are three patches).\\n\\n@ Can I use my favorite window manager with OpenWindows instead of olwm?\\n    Yes.  If you use twm, for example, or mwm, you won\\'t be able to use\\n    the Pin and Unpin feature of olwm, and you (probably) won\\'t see the\\n    footers some windows use to display certain messages.\\n\\n    If you use twm, you\\'ll want to use the f.delete function to unpin menus\\n    and get rid of programs that don\\'t have a `quit\\' button when not run\\n    under olwm.\\n    For twm, put this in your $HOME/.twmrc:\\n\\tLeftTitleButton \"target\" = f.delete\\n    where \"target\" is a 16x16 icon from /usr/include/X11/bitmaps.\\n    Alternatively, try\\n\\t# Add a menu to each window managed by twm or tvtwm\\n\\tLeftTitleButton \":menu\" = f.menu \"OL.menu\"\\n\\n\\tmenu \"OL.menu\" {\\n\\t    \"Quit\"         f.delete\\n\\t}\\n\\n    For mwm, you can double-click on the menu icon on the left of the title\\n    bar to dismiss a pop-up window (I am told).\\n\\n    See the manual page for your window manager (twm, etc).\\n\\nSubject: OpenWindows, Terminals, and Other Displays\\n\\n@ Can I use olwm and olvwm without OpenWindows or on an X Terminal?\\n    The OpenWindows xnews server combines SunView, NeWS (PostScript) and X11.\\n    This means that it can run programs compiled for any of those systems.\\n    Unfortunately, it means that some OpenWindows programs need either NeWS\\n    or SunView support, and thus won\\'t run on an X terminal.  This includes\\n    pageview in particular.\\n\\n    You can use olwm or olvwm (see above) on an X terminal or a non-Open-\\n    Windows display, and most OPEN LOOK clients (e.g. OLIT or XView ones)\\n    will work perfectly well.  You may find that you get complaints about\\n    fonts not being found.  If so, see the Fonts section below.\\n    If you are running the window manager built-in to an NCD terminal, you\\n    may have problems with input focus; setting *Input: True in the terminal\\'s\\n    XDefault file in /usr/lib/X11/xdm may or may not help.\\n\\n\\nSubject: Configuration Files: Getting started with OpenWindows\\n     \\n@ What configuration files do I need to know about?\\n\\n    .xinitrc and .xsessionrc\\n\\n    The first time you run OpenWindows, a .xinitrc file will be created in\\n    your login directory ($HOME).  If it already exists, you might have to\\n    edit it somewhat; it\\'s simplest to move it and any other old X11 files\\n    you have to another directory, and then merge the old and new files.\\n\\n    If your site uses xdm, you should use .xsession instead of .xinitrc,\\n    since xdm doesn\\'t look at your .xinitrc file.\\n\\n    .openwin-init, .openwin-menu and .openwin-sys\\n\\n    These are optional files you can create in your $HOME directory,\\n    depending on which version of olwm or olvwm you use.\\n    Look in $OPENWINHOME/lib (normally /usr/openwin/lib) for these files\\n    without the leading . and copy any you want to change.  You may need\\n    to edit your .xinitrc to get them recognized.  If you are not on an\\n    X terminal, you will want to run a console window (such as cmdtool -C,\\n    shelltool -C, xterm -C) or Chuck Musciano\\'s \"contool\" program so that\\n    system output will be directed there instead of writing over your screen.\\n    Note that .openwin-sys is not executed unless you edit .xinitrc.\\n\\n    .Xdefaults\\n\\n    You can put X Windows resource specifications in here.  In particular,\\n    it is a good idea to include at least:\\n\\tOpenWindows.FocusLenience:\\ttrue\\n\\t*Input: TRUE\\n    These allow non-ICCCM-compliant programs to receive input even if they\\n    forget to ask for it.\\n\\n    Props, the program that runs when you select `properties\\' from the default\\n    root menu under olwm or olvwm, writes your choices into .Xdefaults.\\n    Don\\'t put comments in .Xdefaults, since `props\\' deletes them.\\n\\n    .startup.ps\\n\\n    This is the NeWS user profile file, read by OpenWindows (actually xnews)\\n    on startup.\\t This is documented in the NeWS programming manual, near the\\n    back.  The most useful thing to put here is PostScript code to change\\n    the keyboard repeat rate, although you must be very careful, since a\\n    syntax error in the PostScript means that xnews will either not start up\\n    at all or will get broken in strange ways.\\tThe NeWS manual gives code\\n    that is both incorrect and insufficient.\\n    WARNING: things in this file rarely work on both OpenWindows 2 and 3.\\n\\n    Note that the mouse speed is best set in your .xinitrc with xset m; see\\n    the man page for xset (\"man xset\", and \"xset -help\") for more information.\\n\\n    Here\\'s what $HOME/.startup.ps  should look like if you want a delay of\\n    about a third of a second (300000 microseconds), and a repeat rate of\\n    twenty or so keys per second (30000 microseconds between repeats) for\\n    OpenWindows 3.  You\\'ll have to experiment a bit because the RepeatTime\\n    is the delay between keys sent, and thus doesn\\'t include the time to\\n    process each key, which is probably higher on my 4/110 than on your\\n    SuperSPARC 10/51 GTi injection :-)  Again, this is for OpenWindows 3...\\n\\n\\t% don\\'t want the demos - see p. xxxii of NeWS Toolkit Reference Manual\\n\\t% /IncludeDemos? false def\\n\\n\\tUserProfile begin\\n\\t    /KeyRepeatThresh 0 300000 timeval storetimeval def\\n\\t    /KeyRepeatTime 0 30000 timeval storetimeval def\\n\\t    % Note: 300000 and 30000 differ greatly...\\n\\tend\\n\\n    You must also have a .user.ps file in the same directory, like this:\\n\\n\\t/NeWS 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\\n\\t/TNTCore 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\\n\\t/TNT 3 0 findpackage beginpackage\\n\\n\\tClassRepeatKeys pop\\t% force repeat.ps to autoload\\n\\n\\tendpackage endpackage endpackage\\n\\n    If you change these parameters, you can test them without restarting the\\n    OpenWindows server like this:\\n\\t$ psh -i .startup.ps\\n\\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3\\n\\t$ psh -i\\n\\tWelcome to X11/NeWS Version3\\n\\t/classinit ClassRepeatKeys send\\n\\t%%% now press control-D\\n\\n    You can also either of these two files (.startup.ps and .user.ps) to make\\n    the root window be \"retained\", so that a PostScript drawing on the\\n    background won\\'t be erased when you move windows:\\n\\tframbuffer /Retained true put\\n    will do this.

Lewis (faq%craft@uunet.uu.net) maintains the informative and\\n  well written \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" document.\\n  Its focus is on general X information, while this FAQ concentrates\\n  on performance.\\n\\n  The comp.windows.x FAQ does address the issue of speed, but only with\\n  regards to the X server.  The gist of that topic seems to be:\\n\\t\"Use X11R5, it is faster than R4\".\\n  (Please see the X FAQ for complete details).\\n\\n---------------\\nWindow Managers\\n---------------\\n\\n  There are a lot of window managers out there, with lots of different\\n  features and abilities.  The choice of which to use is by necessity a\\n  balancing act between performance and useful features.  At this\\n  point, most respondents have agreed upon \"twm\" as the best candidate\\n  for a speedy window manager. \\n\\n  A couple of generic tricks you can try to soup up your window manger,\\n  is turning off unnecessary things like \"zooming\" and \"opaque move\".\\n  Also, if you lay out your windows in a tiled manner, you reduce the\\n  amount of cpu power spent in raising and lowering overlapping\\n  windows.                           Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\\n\\n  I\\'ve found that a good font for tiling is 7x13 (aka:\\n  -misc-fixed-medium-r-normal--13-100-100-100-c-70-iso8859-1 ). It is\\n  the biggest font I know of that I can use on my Sun (1152x900 screen)\\n  and still get two 80 column terminal windows side-by-side on the\\n  display with no overlap.  Other font suggestions will be accepted.\\n\\n------------\\nThe X Server\\n------------\\n\\nWhich Server?\\n- - - - - - -\\n  Make sure that your server is a proper match for your hardware.\\n  If you have a monochrome monitor, use a monochrome X11 server.\\n\\n  On my Monochrome Sun, I haven\\'t noticed much difference between\\n  the Xsun (colour) server and XsunMono, however it was pointed out to\\n  me that XsunMono is about 800k smaller and therefore should contribute\\n  to less paging.  \\n         [ thanks to: Jonny Farringdon (j.farringdon@psychol.ucl.ac.uk),\\n                        Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se) ]\\n\\n  How your server was compiled can also make a difference.  Jeff Law\\n  (law@schirf.cs.utah.edu) advises us that on a Sun system, X should be\\n  compiled with gcc (version 2.*) or with the unbundled Sun compiler.\\n  You can expect to get \"*very* large speedups in the server\" by not\\n  using the bundled SunOS compiler.  I assume that similar results\\n  would occur if you used one of the other high-quality commercial\\n  compilers on the market.\\n\\nLocking the Server into RAM?\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Has anyone tried hacking the X server so that it is locked into RAM and\\n  does not get paged?  eg: via a call to plock().  Does this help\\n  performance at all?  I\\'ve had one inquiry on this topic, and a few\\n  pointers to the plock() function call, but no hard evidence from someone\\n  who\\'s tried it.  I am not in a position to give it a try.  \\n\\t\\t\\t  [thanks to: Eric C Claeys (ecc@eperm.att.com),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      Danny Backx (db@sunbim.be),\\n\\t\\t\\t\\t      Juan D. Martin (juando@cnm.us.es) ]\\nStarting your Server\\n- - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\\n    If you start up a lot of clients in your .xsession or whatever, sleep\\n    for a second or two after launching each one.  After I changed my\\n    .xclients script to do this, logging in actually took *less* time...\\n    we have a heavily loaded system without much core, though.\\n\\n  This sounds crazy, but I have confirmed that it works!  \\n\\n  Warner Losh (imp@Solbourne.COM) provided me with a good explanation of\\n  why this works, which I have summarized here:\\n\\n    When you start up an X server it takes a huge amount of time to\\n    start accepting connections.  A lot of initialization is done by\\n    the server when it starts.  This process touches a large number of\\n    pages.  Any other process running at the same time would fight the\\n    server for use of the CPU, and more importantly, memory.  If you\\n    put a sleep in there, you give the Server a chance to get itself\\n    sorted out before the clients start up.\\n\\n    Similarly, there is also a lot of initialization whenever an X\\n    client program starts: toolkits registering widgets, resources\\n    being fetched, programs initializing state and \"databases\" and so\\n    forth.  All this activity is typically memory intensive.  Once this\\n    initialization is done (\"The process has reached a steady state\"),\\n    the memory usage typically settles down to using only a few pages.\\n    By using sleeps to stagger the launching of your clients in your\\n    .Xinitrc , you avoid them fighting each other for your\\n    workstation\\'s limited resources\\n\\n  This is most definitely a \"Your Mileage May Vary\" situation, as there\\n  are so many variables to be considered: available RAM, local swap\\n  space, load average, number of users on your system, which clients\\n  you are starting, etc.\\n\\n  Currently in my .xinitrc I have a situation like:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n  I\\'ve experimented with:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 2; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 3; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 4; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n  I\\'ve even tried:\\n\\t(sleep 2; exec start_X_clients_script ) &\\n  and then in start_X_clients_script I had:\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xclock ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xbiff ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\t(sleep 1; exec xterm ) &\\n\\n    [ The idea with this last one was to make sure that xinit had\\n    completely finished processing my .xinitrc, and had settled down\\n    into a \"steady state\" before the sleep expired and all my clients\\n    were launched. ]\\n\\n  All of these yielded fairly comparable results, and so I just stuck with\\n  my current setup, for its simplicity.  You will probably have to\\n  experiment a bit to find a setup which suits you.\\n\\nFonts\\n- - -\\n  Loading fonts takes time and RAM.  If you minimize the number of fonts\\n  your applications use, you\\'ll get speed increases in load-up time.\\n\\n  One simple strategy is to choose a small number of fonts (one small, one\\n  large, one roman, whatever suits you) and configure all your clients -- or\\n  at least all your heavily used clients -- to use only those few fonts.\\n  Client programs should start up quicker if their font is already loaded\\n  into the server.  This will also conserve server resources, since fewer\\n  fonts will be loaded by the server.\\n\\t\\t\\t      [ Farrell McKay (fbm@ptcburp.ptcbu.oz.au),\\n\\t\\t\\t        Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) ]\\n\\n  eg: My main xterm font is 7x13, so I also have twm set up to use 7x13\\n  in all it\\'s menus and icons etc.  Twm\\'s default font is 8x13.  Since\\n  I don\\'t normally use 8x13, I\\'ve eliminated one font from my server.\\n\\n  Oliver Jones (oj@roadrunner.pictel.com):\\n    Keep fonts local to the workstation, rather than loading them over nfs.\\n    If you will make extensive use of R5 scalable fonts, use a font server.\\n\\nAbout the Resources File\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n    Keep your .Xresources / .Xdefaults file small.  Saves RAM and saves\\n    on server startup time.          Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com)\\n\\n  One suggestion:\\n\\n    In your .Xdefaults (.Xresources) file, try putting only the minimum\\n    number of resources that you want to have available to all of your\\n    applications.  For example:  *reverseVideo: true\\n\\n    Then, separate your resources into individual client-specific\\n    resource files.  For example: $HOME/lib/app-defaults.  In your\\n    .login file set the environment variable XUSERFILESEARCHPATH:\\n\\n\\tsetenv XUSERFILESEARCHPATH $HOME/lib/app-defaults/%N\\n\\n    [ The \"comp.windows.x Frequently Asked Questions\" FAQ contains\\n    an excellent explanation of how these environment variables work.\\n    --ed.]\\n\\n    So, when xterm launches, it loads its resources from\\n    .../app-defaults/XTerm.  Xdvi finds them in .../app-defaults/XDvi,\\n    and so on and so forth.  Note that not all clients follow the same\\n    XXxxx resource-file naming pattern.  You can check in your system\\n    app-defaults directory (often: /usr/X11R5/lib/X11/app-defaults/) to\\n    find the proper name, and then name your personal resource files\\n    with the same name.\\n\\n    This is all documented in the Xt Specification (pg 125 & 666).\\n\\t\\t    [Thanks to: Kevin Samborn (samborn@mtkgc.com),\\n\\t\\t         Michael Urban (urban@cobra.jpl.nasa.gov),\\n\\t\\t             and Mike Long (mikel@ee.cornell.edu).\\n\\t     Kevin is willing mail his setup files to inquirers.]\\n\\n  This method of organizing your personal resources has the following\\n  benefits:\\n\\n    - Easier to maintain / more usable.\\n\\n    - Fewer resources are stored in the X server in the RESOURCE_MANAGER\\n      property.  As a side benefit your server may start fractionally\\n      quicker, since it doesn`t have to load all your resources.\\n\\n    - Applications only process their own resources, never have to sort \\n      through all of your resources to find the ones that affect them.\\n\\n  It also has drawbacks:\\n\\n    - the application that you are interested in has to load an\\n      additional file every time it starts up.  This doesn\\'t seem to\\n      make that much of a performance difference, and you might\\n      consider this a huge boon to usability.  If you are modifying an\\n      application\\'s resource database, you just need to re-run the\\n      application without having to \"xrdb\" again.\\n\\n    - xrdb will by default run your .Xdefaults file through cpp.  When\\n      your resources are split out into multiple resource files and\\n      then loaded by the individual client programs, they will not.\\n      WATCH OUT FOR THIS!!\\n\\n      I had C style comments in my .Xdefaults file, which cpp stripped\\n      out.  When I switched to this method of distributed resource\\n      files I spent several frustrating days trying to figure out why\\n      my clients were not finding their resources.  Xt did *NOT*\\n      provide any error message when it encountered the C style\\n      comments in the resource files, it simply, silently, aborted\\n      processing the resource file.\\n\\n      The loss of preprocessing (which can be very handy, e.g. ``#ifdef\\n      COLOR\\'\\' ...) is enough to cause some people to dismiss this\\n      method of resource management.\\n\\n    - You may also run into some clients which break the rules.  For\\n      example, neither Emacs (18.58.3) nor Xvt (1.0) will find their\\n      resources if they are anywhere other than in .Xdefaults.\\n\\n    - when starting up a client on a machine that does not share files\\n      with the machine where your resources are stored, your client\\n      will not find its resources.  Loading all your resources into the\\n      server will guarantee that all of your clients will always find\\n      their resources.            Casey Leedom (casey@gauss.llnl.gov)\\n\\n  A possible compromise suggestion that I have (and am planning on trying)\\n  is to put resources for all my heavily used clients (eg: xterm) into my\\n  .Xdefaults file, and to use the \"separate resources files\" method for\\n  clients that I seldom use.\\n\\nDefine Your Display Properly\\n- - - - - - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n  Client programs are often executed on the same machine as the server.  In\\n  that situation, rather than setting your DISPLAY environment variable to \\n  \"<hostname>:0.0\", where <hostname> is the name of your workstation, you\\n  should set your DISPLAY variable to \"unix:0.0\" or \":0.0\".  By doing this\\n  you access optimized routines that know that the server is on the same\\n  machine and use a shared memory method of transferring requests.\\n\\t\\t\\t[thanks to Patrick J Horgan (pjh70@ras.amdahl.com)]\\n\\n  See the _DISPLAY NAMES_ section of the X(1) man page for further\\n  explanation of how to properly set your display name.\\n\\n  \"I don\\'t think it\\'s stock MIT, but (at least) Data General and HP have\\n  libraries that are smart enough to use local communication even when\\n  the DISPLAY isn\\'t set specially.\"\\n\\t\\t\\t      Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET)\\n\\n  [Jody Goldberg (jody@algorithmics.com) sent me an Xlib patch to change\\n  stock R5 to use local communication even if DISPLAY is not properly set.\\n  I don\\'t want to get in the business of distributing or trying to juggle\\n  non-MIT patches and so have elected not to include it here.

Think also\\n  about the _kind_ of programs you are running.  For example:  Is there\\n  a smaller clock program than xclock?\\n\\n  Unfortunately, I haven\\'t really noticed that programs advertise how large\\n  they are, so the onus is on us to do the research and spread the word.\\n\\n  [ Suggestions on better alternatives to the some of the standard clients\\n  (eg: Xclock, Xterm, Xbiff) are welcome.  --ed.]\\n\\n  I\\'ve received some contradictory advice from people, on the subject\\n  of X client programs.  Some advocate the use of programs that are\\n  strictly Xlib based, since Xt, Xaw and other toolkits are rather\\n  large.  Others warn us that other applications which you are using\\n  may have already loaded up one or more of these shared libraries.  In\\n  this case, using a non-Xt (for example) client program may actually\\n  _increase_ the amount of RAM consumed.\\n\\n  The upshot of all this seems to be: Don\\'t mix toolkits.  That is, try\\n  and use just Athena clients, or just Xview clients (or just Motif\\n  clients, etc).  If you use more than one, then you\\'re dragging in\\n  more than one toolkit library.\\n\\n  Know your environment, and think carefully about which client\\n  programs would work best together in that environment.\\n\\n\\t\\t  [Thanks to: Rob Sartin (88opensi!sartin@uunet.UU.NET),\\n      Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk | sinclair@uk.ac.gla.dcs) ]\\n\\nA Better Clock for X\\n- - - - - - - - - - -\\n\\n1) xcuckoo\\n   suggested by: Duncan Sinclair (sinclair@dcs.gla.ac.uk)\\n   available: on export.lcs.mit.edu\\n\\n   Xcuckoo displays a clock in the title bar of *another* program.\\n   Saves screen real estate.\\n\\n2) mclock\\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in /X/mclock.shar\\n\\n   Non Xt-based.

I\\'ve heard that\\n   there are versions of xvt with this feature, but I\\'ve not found any\\n   yet.\\n\\n   UPDATE (March 1993):  I recently had a few email conversations with\\n   Brian Warkentin (brian.warkentine@eng.sun.com) regarding xvt.  He\\n   questions whether xvt really is at all faster than xterm.  For\\n   instance, xvt may initialize slightly faster, but compare scrolling\\n   speed (try this quickie benchmark: /bin/time dd if=/etc/termcap\\n   bs=40) and see which program can scroll faster.  Also, while xterm\\n   may be slightly larger in RAM requirements (We don\\'t have any hard\\n   numbers here, does anyone else?) shared libraries and shared text\\n   segments mean that xterm\\'s paging requirements are not that major.\\n\\n   As an experiment, he ripped out all the tek stuff from xterm, but it\\n   made little difference, since if you never use it, it never gets\\n   brought into memory.\\n\\n   So here we stand with some conflicting reports on the validity of\\n   xvt over xterm.  In summary?  Caveat Emptor, your mileage may vary.\\n   If you can provide some hard data, I\\'d like to see it.\\n   Specifically: How much RAM each occupies, how much swap each needs,\\n   relative speed of each\\n\\n2) mterm\\n   suggested by: der Mouse (mouse@Lightning.McRCIM.McGill.EDU)\\n   available: larry.mcrcim.mcgill.edu (132.206.1.1) in\\n     /X/mterm.src/mterm.ball-o-wax.\\n\\n   \"I also have my own terminal emulator.

Examining the what was\\n    going on with xscope I found it.  It seems that when the resource\\n    XmNblinkRate is non-zero and the focus is on a text field widget\\n    (or even just a text widget) the I-beam cursor will blink.\\n    Every time the cursor appears or disappears in those widgets, the\\n    widget code is making a request to the server (CopyArea).  The user\\n    can stop this by setting the resource XmNblinkRate to 0.  It is not\\n    noticeable on a 40MHz SPARC, but it does make a little difference\\n    on a [slower system].\\n\\n  This specific suggestion can probably be applied in general to lots\\n  of areas.  Consider your heavily used clients, are there any minor\\n  embellishments that can be turned off and thereby save on Server\\n  requests?\\n\\n-------------------------\\nMiscellaneous Suggestions\\n-------------------------\\n\\nPretty Pictures\\n- - - - - - - -\\n  Don\\'t use large bitmaps (GIF\\'s, etc) as root window backgrounds.\\n\\n  - The more complicated your root window bitmap, the slower the server\\n    is at redrawing your screen when you reposition windows (or redraw, etc)\\n\\n  - These take up RAM, and CPU power.  I work on a Sun SPARC and I\\'m\\n    conscious of performance issues, I can\\'t comprehend it when I see\\n    people with a 4mb Sun 3/60 running xphoon as their root window.\\n\\n    I\\'ll let someone else figure out how much RAM would be occupied by\\n    having a full screen root image on a colour workstation.\\n\\n  - If you\\'re anything like me, you need all the screen real estate\\n    that you can get for clients, and so rarely see the root window anyway.\\n\\n\\t\\t      [ Thanks to Qiang Alex Zhao (azhao@cs.arizona.edu) \\n\\t\\t\\tfor reminding me of this one. --ed.]\\n\\nA Quicker Mouse\\n- - - - - - - -\\n  Using xset, you can adjust how fast your pointer moves on the screen\\n  when you move your mouse.  I use \"xset m 3 10\" in my .xinitrc file,\\n  which lets me send my pointer across the screen with just a flick of\\n  the wrist.  See the xset man page for further ideas and information.\\n\\n  Hint: sometimes you may want to *slow down* your mouse tracking for\\n  fine work.  To cover my options, I have placed a number of different\\n  mouse setting commands into a menu in my window manager.  \\n\\n  e.g. (for twm) :\\n      menu \"mouse settings\" {\\n        \"Mouse Settings:\"\\t\\t\\tf.title\\n\\t\"  Very Fast\"\\t\\t\\t\\t! \"xset m 7 10 &\"\\n\\t\"  Normal (Fast)\"\\t\\t\\t! \"xset m 3 10 &\"\\n\\t\"  System Default (Un-Accelerated)\"\\t! \"xset m default &\"\\n\\t\"  Glacial\"\\t\\t\\t\\t! \"xset m 0 10 &\"\\n      }\\n\\nProgramming Thoughts\\n- - - - - - - - - - -\\n  Joe English (joe@trystero.art.com) :\\n    To speed up applications that you\\'re developing, there are tons of\\n    things you can do.  Some that stick out:\\n\\n    - For Motif programs, don\\'t set XmFontList resources for individual\\n      buttons, labels, lists, et. al.; use the defaultFontList or\\n      labelFontList or whatever resource of the highest-level manager\\n      widget.  Again, stick to as few fonts as possible.\\n\\n    - Better yet, don\\'t use Motif at all.  It\\'s an absolute pig.\\n\\n    - Don\\'t create and destroy widgets on the fly.  Try to reuse them.\\n      (This will avoid many problems with buggy toolkits, too.)\\n\\n    - Use a line width of 0 in GCs.  On some servers this makes a HUGE\\n      difference.\\n\\n    - Compress and collapse multiple Expose events.  This can make the\\n      difference between a fast application and a completely unusable\\n      one.\\n\\n  Francois Staes (frans@kiwi.uia.ac.be) :\\n    Just a small remark: I once heard that using a better malloc\\n    function would greatly increase performance of Xt based\\n    applications since they use malloc heavily. They suggested trying\\n    out the GNUY malloc, but I didn\\'t find the time yet. I did some\\n    tests on small programs just doing malloc and free, and the\\n    differences were indeed very noticeable ( somewhat 5 times faster)\\n\\n  [ Any confirmation on this from anyone?  --ed.]\\n\\n  Andre\\' Beck (Andre_Beck@IRS.Inf.TU-Dresden.de) :\\n\\n  - Unnecessary NoExpose Events.\\n\\n    Most people use XCopyArea/XCopyPlane as fastest blit routines, but\\n    they forget to reset graphics_exposures in the GC used for the\\n    blits. This will cause a NoExpose Event every blit, that, in most\\n    cases, only puts load onto the connection and forces the client to\\n    run through it\\'s event-loop again and again.\\n\\n  - Thousands of XChangeGC requests.\\n\\n    This \"Gfx Context Switching\" is also seen in most handcoded X-Apps,\\n    where only one or few GCs are created and then heavily changed\\n    again and again.  Xt uses a definitely better mechanism, by caching\\n    and sharing a lot of GCs with all needed parameters. This will\\n    remove the load of subsequent XChangeGC requests from the\\n    connection (by moving it toward the client startup phase).\\n\\nSay What!?\\n- - - - - - \\n  Some contributors proposed ideas that seem right off the wall at first:\\n\\n  David B. Lewis (by day: dbl@osf.org, by night: david%craft@uunet.uu.net) :\\n    How about this: swap displays with someone else. Run all your programs\\n    on the other machine and display locally; the other user runs off your\\n    machine onto the other display. Goal: reduce context switches in the\\n    same operation between client and server.\\n\\n  I\\'m not in a situation where I can easily try this, but I have received\\n  the following confirmation...\\n\\n  Michael Salmon (Michael.Salmon@eos.ericsson.se):\\n    I regularly run programs on other machines and I notice a big\\n    difference.

Not really a\\n    major problem, except that the X11 client and the server are in\\n    absolute synchronicity and are context thrashing.\\n\\n  Timothy H Panton (thp@westhawk.uucp) :\\n    Firstly it relies on the fact that most CPU\\'s are mostly idle, X\\'s\\n    cpu usage is bursty.  so the chances of you and your teammate\\n    doing something cpu-intensive at the same time is small. If they\\n    are not then you get twice the cpu+memory available for your\\n    action.\\n\\n    The second factor is that context switches are expensive, using 2\\n    cpu\\'s halves them, you pay a price due to the overhead of going\\n    over the network, but this is offset in most cases by the improved\\n    buffering of a network (typically 20k vs 4k for a pipe), allowing\\n    even fewer context switches.\\n\\n----------------------------\\nOther Sources of Information\\n----------------------------\\n\\n  Volume 8 in O\\'Reilly\\'s X Window System Series, ``X Window System\\n  Administrator\\'s Guide\\'\\' is a book all X administrator\\'s should read.\\n\\n  Adrian Nye (adrian@ora.com):\\n    A lot more tips on performance are in the paper \"Improving X\\n    Application Performance\" by Chris D.

I used to think this was true, but more and more I\\'m becoming\\nconvinced that it\\'s the other way around: among players with the physical\\nability to hit the ball real hard, the patient ones are the ones who get the\\nchance to do it a lot.\\n\\nLet\\'s break down the four basic categories of hitter, according to whether\\nthey are power threats and whether they walk a lot:\\n\\n\\n\\t\\t\\tPower\\t\\t\\tNo Power\\n\\n\\tPatient\\t\\tFrank Thomas\\t\\tBrett Butler\\n\\t\\t\\tBarry Bonds\\t\\tOzzie Smith\\n\\t\\t\\tMark McGwire\\t\\tCraig Grebeck\\n\\t\\t\\tBabe Ruth\\t\\tMiller Huggins\\n\\t\\t\\tTed Williams\\t\\tBilly Hamilton\\n\\t\\t\\tRickey Henderson\\tEddie Joost\\n\\t\\t\\tJoe Morgan\\t\\tMike Hargrove\\n\\t\\t\\t   .\\t\\t\\t   .\\n\\t\\t\\t   .\\t\\t\\t   .\\n\\t\\t\\t   .\\t\\t\\t   .\\n\\n\\tImpatient\\tErnie Banks\\t\\tOzzie Guillen\\n\\t\\t\\tDave Kingman\\t\\tShawon Dunston\\n\\t\\t\\tJoe Carter\\t\\tAndres Thomas\\n\\t\\t\\tGeorge Bell\\t\\tJose Lind\\n\\t\\t\\tKirby Puckett\\t\\tDevon White\\n\\tetc.\\n\\nAs far as I can tell, all the categories are full.  It really looks like the\\ntwo are independent.  Nobody could possibly be *afraid* of Craig Grebeck at\\nthe plate, and yet he walks quite a lot.  Part of that, undoubtedly, is being\\nsmall of stature, but surely major league pitchers can hit that sort of \\ntarget at least 3 times out of 6.  Randy Milligan is an even better example;\\nhe\\'s only shown noticeable power for one (partial) season, but he walks all\\nover the place, despite his huge strike zone.\\n\\n',\n",
       " ': However greatly we extoll Mary, it is quite obvious that she is in no\\n: way God or even part of God or equal to God.  The Assumption of our\\n: Blessed Mother, meant that because of her close identification with the\\n: redemptive work of Christ, she was Assumed (note that she did not\\n: ASCEND) body and soul into Heaven, and is thus one of the few, along\\n: with Elijah, Enoch, Moses (maybe????) who are already perfected in\\n: Heaven.  Obviously, the Virgin Mary is far superior in glorification to\\n: any of the previously mentioned personages.\\n\\n\\nAs I said, it is a provocative thought.\\n\\nFrom \"Answer to Job\":\\n\\n\\tThe logical consistency of the papal declaration cannot be surpassed\\n\\tand it leaves Protestantism with the odium of being nothing but a\\n\\t_man\\'s religion_ which allows no metaphysical representation of woman.\\n\\t...Protestantism has obviously not given sufficient attention to the\\n\\tsigns of the times which point to the equality of women.  But this\\n\\tequality requires to be metaphysically anchored in the figure of a\\n\\t\"divine\" woman, the bride of Christ.  Just as the person of Christ\\n\\tcannot be replaced by an organization, so the bride cannot be re-\\n\\tplaced by the Church.  The feminine, like the masculine, demands an\\n\\tequally personal representation.\\n\\t\\tThe dogmatizing of the Assumption does not, however, according\\n\\tto the dogmatic view, mean that Mary has attained the status of a\\n\\tgoddess, although, as mistress of heaven...and mediatrix, she is \\n\\tfunctionally on a par with Christ, the king and mediator. At any\\n\\trate, her position satisfies the need of the archetype. [par. 753-4]\\n\\n\\n: Jung should stick to Psychology rather than getting into Theology.\\n\\nJung made it clear that he was talking about psychology, not theology.

       " \": Hi there,\\n: \\n: I'm german and I have been into this MLB stuff since almost one year now.\\n: There are many problems occuring for me. One of them is the ERA statistic for\\n: pitchers. What does it say ??\\n\\nERA indicates the average number of earned runs attributed to a pitcher per\\nnine inning game.  Thus, if a pitcher pitched 3 innings and gave up 1 earned\\nrun, his 9 inning equivelent perfomance would be 3 earned runs, thus his ERA\\nis 3.00.  To compute the ERA you simply take the number of earned runs divided\\nby the innings pitched and then multiple the result by 9.\\n\\n\\tERA = (ER/IP) * 9\\n\\nAn earned run is run that is given up by the pitcher that is not attributed\\nto a fielding error.  More specifically, if an error occurs that represented\\nthe third out, all runs scored after the error are considered UNEARNED runs.\\nEarned runs are also runs scored as a result of players who were left on base\\nwhen the pitcher exited the game.  Here are some examples:\\n\\n\\tIf there are two outs in an inning and there are men on base.  If\\n\\tan error occurs that represents the third out, all of the runs after\\n\\tthis error and NOT counted as earned runs.\\n\\n\\tIf a pitcher issues some base on balls (walks), and leaves the game\\n\\tbefore the inning is completed, he is responsible for the people who\\n\\twere left on base.  If the those runners who were left on base score,\\n\\tand the score was not a result of an error, those eraned runs are\\n\\tattributed to the pitcher who left the game.\\n\\nI hope this explains things for you.\",\n",

Who says both are by faith? This interpretation has the\\nadvantage of explaining those who are faithlessly baptized, for whom their\\nbaptisim is not benefit, but serves to put them into the kingdom nonetheless.\\n\\nLike the israelites (all of them, children included) who were baptized in\\nthe cloud and in the sea, it was of no advantage because they did not add\\nto their baptism faith and obedience.\\n\\nBaptism does not impart faith, nor is it done strictly speaking on the\\nbasis of the faith of the parent, but because of the covcenant promise of\\nGod. It imparts grace, the grace of the kingdom, which can be a\\npunishement in disguise if there is later apostacy.\\n\\n\\n\\nDo you teach a child to pray the Lord\\'s prayer? Do you expect them to not\\nsteal? They *can* have faith appropriate to their condition.

For example,\\nif I decide that the fact that John the Baptist is Elijah teaches the\\ndoctrine of reincarnation, I am wrong because that is not the intended\\ninterpretation.

Certainly we must rely on our best efforts to\\ndetermine what this meaning is, but this very fact should make us\\nrecognize that our private interpretations cannot be automatically\\naccepted as the infallible interpretation of God.

       " \"Tim Shippert recently posted summaries of last year's Defensive Average\\nstats in terms of the Linear Weights estimated run-value of defensive\\nperformances, compared to league average.  I've combined those with my\\nposition-adjusted MLV numbers to come up with first-approximation total\\nrun values for players last year.  We can use these as a springboard for\\nreconsideration of the MVP award.\\n\\nMajor caveats:  these numbers include no defensive park adjustment, so if\\nSan Diego really is just a question of odd scoring or gopher holes in the\\ninfield, that will cause some inaccuracies.  The offensive numbers are\\nposition-adjusted, but not park adjusted, so we have to deflate some and\\ninflate others to be fair.  Finally, we still don't know what to do about\\ncatchers, and I have no idea how to evaluate the defensive contributions \\nof Tony Phillips and Bip Roberts.  \\n\\nHaving said that, there are still some surprises.

Had Bonds been his usual defensive self, it\\nwouldn't have been close, but that apparently wasn't the case.  Darren\\nDaulton needs 22 or more defensive runs to make up the offensive difference,\\nand I couldn't tell you whether that's easy or impossible.

I certainly didn't, but I'd have a hard time\\narguing against him at this point.  Yes, I know these numbers are only\\napproximate, but that's a big gap between him and the #2 guy.  Also, those\\nof you who thought Rickey Henderson stank last year are out of your minds.\\n\\nOnce again, there's a catcher in the ointment.  If calling a game is as\\nimportant as it might be, 23 runs is easy to make up (or give away).  TAke\\na guess, folks; I don't think we can do any better than that.\\n\\nMy personal vote (excluding pitchers):\\n\\n\\tVentura, Tettleton, Anderson, Martinez, Henderson.\\n\\nI'm a big Frank Thomas fan, but I have to admit to a bias in favor of\\nbalanced offensive/defensive contribution, which should have a higher\\nleverage in W/L record than an equal shift that is lots of offense with\\nnegative defense.\\n\\nFor the record:\\n\\n\\tCarlos Baerga\\t\\t  27\\t\\t  5\\t\\t  32\\n\\tRoberto Alomar\\t\\t  35\\t\\t -2\\t\\t  33\\n\\nForget it; it's a wash.\\n\\nLet me also take this opportunity to admit that I was grossly wrong regarding\\nDon Mattingly's defense this past season.

To allow the execution\\nXof X programs, it copies a number of environmental variables to\\nXthe remote session.  If you omit\\nX.IR command ,\\nXthen rx will start an xterm on the remote host.  The\\nX.B rxterm\\nXvarient starts a remote xterm on a host, and also passes\\nX.I args\\nXto the remote xterm as arguments.\\nX.PP\\nXShell metacharacters which are not quoted are interpreted on the local\\nXmachine, while quoted metacharacters are interpreted on the remote\\nXmachine.\\nX.PP\\nXIf the name of the file from which\\nX.B rx\\nXis executed is anything other than ``rx,\\'\\'\\nX.B rx\\nXtakes this name, stripped on a leading ``r\\'\\' as the command\\nXto run on the remote host, using any\\nX.I command\\nXparameters as arguments for the remote command.\\nX.PP\\nXIf\\nX.B rx\\nXthinks you are using\\nX.B xauth\\nXbased X authorisation, and you are calling to a off-site host, or\\nXto a different username, it will attempt to copy an authorization\\nXkey to the remote account.

       " 'Hypostasis\\n\\n[I\\'ve explained it here before.  If you want the full document, ask me by mail\\n--Rex] \\n\\n\\n   \"Questions arise as we begin to think about LOGOS and what His inner\\nconsciousness was composed of. We need to clarify the two natures of Christ\\nbriefly.  The divine nature, which has existed eternally, did not undertake any\\nessential changes during the incarnation which would cause a conflict with the\\nattributes of God, the foremost of these being His immutability.  This would\\nmean that it remained impassable, that is, incapable of suffering and death,\\nfree from ignorance and insusceptible to weakness and temptation.  In the realm\\nof the divine nature it is better to say that the Son of God became that which\\nwas not absolute-and in Himself.  The result of the incarnation was that the\\ndivine LOGOS could be ignorant and weak, could be tempted and suffer and die,\\nnot in His divine nature, but by the derivation of His possession of a human\\nnature.\\n     This would mean that both the properties of the divine nature and the\\nhuman nature are properties of the person, and therefore ascribed to the\\nperson. By this reason we can say that the person can be omnipotent,\\nomniscient, and omnipresent, yet at the same time be also a man of limited\\npower, knowledge, a man of sorrows, subject to human wants and miseries.  There\\nis, however, no penetration of one nature into the other.  Deity can no more\\nshare the imperfections of humanity than humanity can share in the essential\\nperfection of the Godhead.\\n     We are not to assume that there is a double personality due to the\\npossession of the double natures.  Christ\\'s human nature is impersonal, in that\\nit attains self-consciousness and self-determination in the personality of the\\nGod-man.  We must now differentiate between the person and the nature of the\\nMan. Nature is defined:\\n\\n\"the distinguishing qualities or properties of something; the fundamental\\ncharacter, disposition or temperament of a living being, innate and\\nunchangeable.\"\\n\\n     Nature is then, in essence, the substance possessed in common, in as such\\nthe Trinity have one nature.  There is also a common nature of mankind. \\nPersonality, on the other hand, is the separate subsistence of nature, with the\\npower of consciousness and will.  It is for this reason that the human nature\\nof Christ has not, nor ever had, a separate subsistence, that it is impersonal.\\n LOGOS, the God-man, represents the principle of personality.  It is equally\\nimportant to see that self-consciousness and self-determination do not, as\\nsuch, belong to the nature.  It is for this reason that we can justifiably say\\nthat Jesus did not have two consciousness or two wills, but rather one.  It is\\ntheanthropic, an activity of the one personality which unites in itself the\\nhuman and the divine natures, being that neither the consciousness nor the will\\nare simply human or simply divine.\"\\n\\n\\n[The quotation given above is not identified, and it\\'s not entirely\\nclear to me what position Loren is taking on it.  Just for clarity,\\nlet me note that the view expressed in it is one of the classic\\nChristological heresies -- monothelitism.  That\\'s the position that\\nChrist\\'s two natures were not complete, in that there was only one\\nwill.  In most cases (which I think includes this example), it was the\\nhuman will that was regarded as missing.\\n\\nNormally people who talk about Christ\\'s human nature as being\\n\"impersonal\" mean it in a somewhat more abstract sense.  That is, they\\nare using \"person\" as hypostatis, not in the usual English sense of\\npersonality.  In this use, the doctrine is called \"anhypostasia\".\\nPersonally I think anhypostasia is just a more sophisticated way of\\ndenying that the Logos took on humanity fully.  However it has never\\nbeen formally ruled a heresy, and in fact has been held by influential\\ntheologians both ancient and modern (e.g. Athanasius).  But the\\nquotation above appears to be going farther than even Athanasius went,\\ninto the realm of the overtly heretical.',\n",
       " \"\\nI think that if someone often has immoral dreams, like lustful dreams, \\nor dreams where you commit acts of violence, etc. etc. it may be a sign \\nthat he has something sinful in his heart.  It may be the Holy Spirit's\\nway of allowing the sinfulness that is in us to come to light so that\\nwe can pray about it and have it removed.  Generally, if one has a \\npure heart, and sets his mind on things that are holy, he will be holy\\neven when he dreams.\\n\\nDreams also can be from the Lord.  Joseph and Nebucadnezzar are two examples\\nof people in the Bible who received dreams from the Lord.  \\n\\nRegarding out of body experiences, this is something that we have to be\\ncareful with.  What is called an OOBE can be spiritual in nature, especially\\nif what one saw is the same as an experience witnessed by someone else.\\nChristians should certainly avoid any occult activity that would generate\\nan out of body experience.  Some things that might be called an OOBE\\nmight actually be from the Lord.  Paul wrote of what might of been an OOBE.\\nIn II Corinthians 12, he wrote of a spiritual experience of being caught\\nup into the third heaven.  Is an OOBE truely an OOBE?  Does one really\\nleave his body, or is he just seeing an image being shown to him by a\\nspirit, be it a demon or the Holy Spirit?  I don't think it matters\\nthat much.  Paul could not tell.  \\n\\nBe that as it may, we should be careful not to open ourselves up to Satan\\nto experience OOBE's.  We should not meditate and pretend we are in a \\nplace until our spirits apparently float there.  This is dangerous.  If\\nGod wants to gice us what seems like an OOBE, then He can do that of His\\nown sovereign will.  In the Bible, most often it seems that prophets are\\njust taken up by God's sovereign will, and not because they are seeking\\nan OOBE.  John was in the Spirit praying on the Lord's day when he was\\ncaught up in the visions he received.  Ezekial was talking with some\\nJewish leaders when he was caught up into the visions of God one\\ntime.  If God wants to take one of us up into a vision, he can do it.\\nPeople should be careful not to open themselves up to evil spirits\\nfor the sake of a few thrills.\",\n",

Notice that Paul did not say that the sin was in commiting\\nadultery, etc.- he spoke against having one\\'s father\\'s wife.  \\n\\nNotice also that this sexual condemnation in Leviticus is not mentioned\\nin the specific context of paganism either.  And there was no pagan \\ncoustom mentioned in I corinthians either.  As a matter of fact\\ntaking one\\'s father\\'s wife wasn\\'t even done among the Gentiles.  It was\\njust a plain blantant sin, whether worshipping idols was involved or\\nnot.\\n\\n\\nOne of the reasons that some of us do not accept that common argument\\nis because Paul probably did face this and other problems.  Sin can\\nbe tough to over come, especially without supernatural power.  Is\\nhomosexual sin any more difficult to overcome that heterosexual sin,\\nlike lusting after a married woman, or sleeping around with people of\\nthe opposite sex?  I doubt it, and even if it is, that is no excuse.\\nGod is greater than all of it. \\n\\nAnother reason we reject it is because it ignores the supernatural\\npower of God to intervene in this kind of situation.  How many \\npeople have been set free from sin by the power of God?  Sure there\\nmay be any groups that have tried to change homosexuals and failed.\\nThat is a reflection on the people involved in the program, and not\\nGod\\'s willingness and ability to change a sinner.  Any program that\\nuses formulas may fail.  What people need is the power of God to\\nchange them, whether they are involved in homosexual sin, or any other\\nsin.\\n\\n\\nI don\\'t see how you come to that conclusion.  Paul\\'s dealings with\\npastorial issues encouraged people to give up their liberties in order\\nto spare others- not to allow people to continue in sin because it\\nwas just too difficult.  Take the example of eating meat offered to idols.\\nPaul felt that there was nothing wrong, in an abstract sense, with\\neating the meat.  Yet he advised believers to sacrifice their liberty\\nto eat meat in order to spare others.  \\n\\nBut Paul never allowed people to sin because living holy was just to\\ntough.  Paul wrote to \"make no provision for the flesh to fulfill the lusts\\nthereof.\"  (Romans 13:14)  Then he goes in to a discourse on how we\\nshould sacrifice our own liberty in order to spare the consciences of others.\\n\\nSuppose it were not a sin for people to practice homosexual acts.  \\nSince others consider it to be a sin, then using Paul\\'s approach\\non pastorial issues, those who would otherwise be homosexuals should \\nsacrifice their liberty and be celbate or monogamously married to a\\nmember of the opposite sex.  Paul never offers a lesser sin (homosexual\\n\"marriage\") to prevent people from engaging in what may be considered \\na more damaging sin.\\n\\n\\nYet marriage itself is not a sin.  marriage is holy in all- and something\\nthat God ordains, and Paul recognizes this.\\n\\n\\nActually, Adam was put in the garden to tend to it before he fell.\\nAfter he fell he would have to toil over the ground.\\n\\n\\nThat is why we are dependent totally on God- what a vunerable and glorious\\nposition to be it.  We all must be transformed by the renewing of our\\nminds- and that is the only way homosexuals can walk in freedom, just\\nlike anyone else.\\n\\n\\nI\\'m sure you can see how people with the opposing view see this \\nconclusion.  It\\'s like saying, \"How should I kill myself, with gun or\\naresenic?  What about the person who just is overcome with a desire to\\nsleep with goats?  Would it be better for him to sleep with one goat,\\nor all of them?  What about the person who wants to sleep with his aunts?\\nWould it be better for him to sleep with one aunt or all of them?  \\n\\nIn all these cases, the more people or animals one sleeps with, the higher\\nthe chance that they will get a disease.  But this only deals with \\nphysical aspects of the question.  Whichever sin is commited, it all \\nleads to spiritual death.\\n\\n\\nThe issue that is most often addressed in Scripture seems to be the\\nactual act.  Second, isn\\'t it historical snobbery to say that\\nonly homosexuals of this century are capable of having \"loving\\nrelationships?\"  There are ancient writings glorifying homosexual \"love.\"\\n(btw, I am one who believes in refraining from making oathes.
